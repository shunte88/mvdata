The current buffer-assignment dump is not very suitable for the eyeballing and it is in use by some scripts that parse its content.

Lets introduce ....-memory-usage-report.txt file that has summarised version of the memory allocation data that could be checked by eyes.

Let's sort the allocations by size (Z-A). As a result we will see the total requirements and them most memory consuming buffers together. And the biggest one will be at the top.

Let's dump the values in an allocation grouped by offset and ordered by size(Z-A) of the slice. Let's add the counted list of shapes that share the same offset.

IFRT's assembly/disassembly operations
(`Client::AssembleArrayFromSingleDeviceArray`,
`Array::DisassembleIntoSingleDeviceArrays`, and related methods in `Sharding`)
treated all shards equally without distinguishing the addressability of the
device of the shards. This had practical problems:

* When the user only has single-device arrays for addressable devices, and
asssemble them into a multi-shard array, the user is forced to use a `Sharding`
that only contains addressable devices. However, with SPMD, it is common to use
a `Sharding` that can express both adressable/non-addressable shards (e.g.,
`HloSharding`).

* When the user has a multi-shard array that spans both
addressable/non-addressable devices, disassembling the array into single-device
arrays would create a single-device array with no addressable devices, which is
often not well supported in the user code because the user code sometimes makes
a strong assumption that any array contains at least one addressable device.

On the other hand, making assembly/diassembly handle only addressable shards is
not future proof. An MPMD setup (not all inputs use a single device mesh) can
see an array with no addressable devices. Thus, changing assembly/diassembly
sematics to handle only addressable shards is too restrictive.

To resolve this single-device array addressability issue, this change makes it
explicit whether only addressable shards will be processed or all shards will
be processed in assembly/disassembly operations.

This change extends `Client::AssembleArrayFromSingleDeviceArray` and
`Array::DisassembleIntoSingleDeviceArrays` methods to be able to handle
addressable shards only.

It will be done in subsequent changes to make the IFRT user code to request
only addressable devices.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/17173

When contracting dim is sharded, both LHS and RHS will be sharded and the partial dots' results will be accumulated. However the accumulation is done 1 step at a time which leads to a number of individual add kernels, these add kernels will impact overlap between gemms due to:
1. they each occupy SMs which prevent gemm overlap
2. they might be fused by gemm_rewriter which introduces data dependency between gemms

This pr optimizes it to get rid of partial accumulations, instead all partials will be concatenated into a contiguous buffer and a global reduction is applied on the buffer.

2562218209,pull_request,open,,[TFLite] Add feature to access `tflite::LoggerOptions` from C API,"# Overview

Issue: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/74882

This PR will provide C API with a more detailed or suppressed way of logging by adding feature to access `tflite::LoggerOptions` from C API.

Here is [the code](https://gist.github.com/kokeshing/3ad87c17f0291811a3b6eb7d25c6678e) to verify the working of this PR.

# Changes

- Added `TfLiteLogSeverity` enum corresponding to `tflite::LogSeverity` enum
- Added binding functions for `tflite::LoggerOptions::GetMinimumLogSeverity()` and `tflite::LoggerOptions::SetMinimumLogSeverity()`
- Reflect in build config to explicitly use newly included files
- Added unit test

# Review points

- New APIs are implemented in the C experimental API since `tflite::LoggerOptions` is described as an experimental API in [logger.h](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/67e9c596f345c27a47936a5492bf32115ebaefcb/tensorflow/lite/logger.h#L21).
- I could not use the `tflite::LogSeverity` enum definition directly because logger.h is a C++ header, so I had to define a new corresponding `TfLiteLogSeverity` enum in c_api_experimental.h.
  - To prevent the two definitions from mismatching, I added `LINT.IfChange` like the [`TfLiteType`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/67e9c596f345c27a47936a5492bf32115ebaefcb/tensorflow/lite/core/c/c_api_types.h#L123).
  - Like other C APIs, I named constants in the enum like constant names (e.g., kFooBar). However, constants in `tflite::LogSeverity` are named like macro (e.g., FOO_BAR).
- Is testing required? I added a test as well as [minimal_logging_test.cc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/67e9c596f345c27a47936a5492bf32115ebaefcb/tensorflow/lite/minimal_logging_test.cc#L63), but often there are no tests for other functions that just call the C++ API. 
- There is a part in [c_api_experimental_test.cc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c30560b5bf0878ade38d6b3ae68b5c9d9436a33f/tensorflow/lite/core/c/c_api_experimental_test.cc) that is changed by clang-format, so I have applied it only to the part I implemented in this PR.

a) MSVC's std::unordered_map says behavior is undefined if the hash function throws an exception (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/unordered-map-class?view=msvc-170#emplace). That's easy to work around, though: we can just precompute all the hash functions.
b) my idiom for avoiding heterogenous lookups had a use after free problem: the weakref callback is called after the object is already in an invalid state. However, there's a much simpler solution: just create the weakref object and use it as a key unconditionally. Yes, this will mean we create more weak references than perhaps we had to otherwise. But this is simple and obviously correct.

Updates `github/codeql-action` from 3.26.6 to 3.26.10
<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md"">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>
<p>See the <a href=""https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases"">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>
<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/17636

This is a followup PR to https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15144. A distributed cache is maintained when device addresses are shared across ranks. There are two issues withe the existing implementation:

1. The cache is not guarded by mutex;
2. The cache initialization process have redundant access.

These issues can cause race condition or dead lock when the progress on different ranks are very close. Consequently we need to introduce below enhancements:

1. Guard the cache with mutex;
2. Shard the initialization process by rank, so that each rank only handle a piece of the cache and should not have overlapping access in theory.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/17440

Related to https://github.com/openxla/xla/issues/17276 and https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/16975. 
This PR updates the GemmRewriter to handle the transpose of non-descending layouts directly, eliminating the need for the layout_normalization pass to correct this error-prone pattern post-rewrite. The desired transformation is now injected into GemmRewriter, ensuring the problematic layout is handled internally. This PR transforms the following error-prone pattern, where the transpose of a non-descending layout is the issue:
```
a = f8e4m3fn[x,y]{0,1} xxx
transpose.0 = f8e4m3fn[y,x]{0,1} transpose(a), dimensions=(1,0)
custom-call(a,...)
```
to 
```
a = f8e4m3fn[x,y]{0,1} xxx
bt = f8e4m3fn[y,x]{1,0} bitcast(a)
transpose.1 = f8e4m3fn[x,y]{1,0} transpose(bt), dimensions=(1,0)
bt.1= f8e4m3fn[y,x]{0,1} bitcast(transpose.1)
custom-call(bt.1,...)

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/16520

Here I added **ResetStream** function which sets the underlying stream for cublas/rocblas libraries to default stream 0.

This is useful for GemmAlgorithmPicker which uses a temporary stream object for autotuning. In rocblas, **rocblas_set_stream** function is **persistent**, meaning that once the stream value is set, it will be used in all subsequent computations until new stream value is set. 

In case of GemmAlgorithmPicker, we leave a **destroyed** stream object set into the math library. This does not produce any error behaviour but merely just a warning on ROCM side: ""Stream Capture Check Failed"".

With this new ResetStream function, one can reset the stream value in GemmAlgorithmPicker destructor. Potentially, it can also be useful in other places where temporary stream value is used.

Besides, I have also made some small code restructure for GemmAlgorithmPicker

@xla-rotation: could you have a look please?

The number of warps used to process a computation determines how many
registers we are able to use concurrently. Therefore, looking at the largest
(padded) tile size makes sense, since it determines the minimum number of
elements that must be live concurrently.

Previously, the logic erroneously only looked at the output tile sizes.

This approach is not perfect, and may be further improved by e.g. doing a
live range analysis on the tiles of the computation.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15577

With the existing `enable_mock_nccl` setting it is impossible to warm up compilation cache when there are multiple processes per node. This is because the cache key includes topology and GPU topology contains information about number of slices and number of hosts per slice. The current mocking of topologies always sets num_hosts_per_slice to 1. However, if you have multiple GPUs on a node and run a process-per-GPU then num_hosts_per_slice must be set to the number of GPUs.

This patch allows setting num_hosts_per_slice explicitly when creating the GPU client.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/17704

Allows passing an additional boolean argument `use_compression` via `xla_extension.get_distributed_runtime_client(...)` that controls whether compression is enabled on the gRPC channels created for each distributed runtime client.

Motivation: XLA sends O(mesh) [device topologies](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/9fb4f21c3542c10b6a5bd98144801bbeec10b489/xla/pjrt/distributed/protocol.proto#L84) through its centralized coordination service and we have reason to believe that this becomes a bottleneck at large scale. Compression of the underlying gRPC communication is currently implicitly disabled, and might give us a cheap avenue to scale a bit further with the centralized KV store design.

One small note: I refrained from adding `use_compression` to `DistributedRuntimeClient::Options` because the new flag is only relevant during channel creation in `distributed.cc`, but not within `DistributedRuntimeClient`. If we added `use_compression` to Options then the `GetDistributedRuntimeClient(channel, options)` defined in `client.cc` would seem to allow controlling compression, but it's really ignored. Let me know if you'd rather go that way.

XLA doesn't inline call instructions and their functions if the call instruction has `backend_config`. As such in Shardy we do the same. GSPMD propagation also adds shardings on the call instruction and function inputs/outputs.

However, when given this module:

HLO conversion removes the call instruction and `@called_computation` shardings. This PR preserves them.

The number of warps used to process a computation determines how many
registers we are able to use concurrently. Therefore, looking at the largest
(padded) tile size makes sense, since it determines the minimum number of
elements that must be live concurrently.

Previously, the logic erroneously only looked at the output tile sizes.

This approach is not perfect, and may be further improved by e.g. doing a
live range analysis on the tiles of the computation.

This allows the ArenaPlanner to match the dynamic Reshape input and output

Since now we can exclude targets from building using tags, we won't need the `cuda_only_cc_library` rule anymore.

This also required me to remove some wrongly added dependencies, notably I found several targets depending on cublas_plugin, even though those targets were not CUDA specific and shouldn't directly depend on CUDA-specific targets.

I also found out that the `tsl_gpu_library` macro is not handling its `cuda_deps` attribute correctly. It was adding those dependencies both for ROCm and for CUDA. So this change is fixing that as well.
