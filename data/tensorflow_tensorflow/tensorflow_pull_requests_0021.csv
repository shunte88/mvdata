Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/18959

The PipelinedP2PRewriter had two issues:

 1. For computations that did not have any collectives - the ProcessComputation function did not set the flag `collective_in_computation[computation]` to false. This caused crash on operations like `sort` with a no-collective computation.
 2. For fusion operations, the p2p rewriter assumed that there would be no collective emitted. In case of dynamic-slice-fusion, it may invoke a collective. So, changed this to handle it the same way for both fused and non-fused computations.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/18883

HLO Conditional operation has two forms:

Form1: Conditional(pred, true_operand, true_computation, false_operand, false_computation)
- binary selections

Form2: Conditional(branch_index, branch_computations, branch_operands)
- branch_index - tells what branch and operand to use
- branch_computations - list (can be larger than 2)
- branch_operands - list (can be larger than 2)

HLO operations semantics: https://openxla.org/xla/operation_semantics#conditional

The ConditionalToSelect pass currently lacks support for Form2 and incorrectly assumes operand0 is always of type PRED and the op has true_computation attr, leading to XLA crashes. This PR adds support for cases where operand0 is of type S32 and the op has branch_computations list.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/18772

This PR provides an option to disable combining all-gathers inside while loop bodies. 
It is set to true, so existing behavior is maintained. 

This option is provided as some strategies for FSDP may only want to coalesce collectives that are outside of a while loop. Collectives inside while loop are not coalesced, as we assume there is sufficient compute to overlap.

2630145783,pull_request,closed,,Gracefully cancel any pending barriers when a task goes away.,"Gracefully cancel any pending barriers when a task goes away.

Whenever possible, the sender (agent) should cancel these RPCs to decrease the likelihood of the receiver (service) holding on to invalid callbacks and attempting to respond to invalid RPC objects.

While the RPC layer should be resilient to such issues, additional defense in depth is good. The service code can still invoke the invalid callbacks later, but the underlying RPC layer knows that the other party cancelled the call, and so wouldn't attempt to respond over a broken pipe.

The other RPCs are responded almost immediately and are unlikely to hit such edge cases (we can opt to harden this but I've not observed any actual bugs yet).

Use of tf.where: Instead of directly throwing an error, you can use tf.where to replace values in B that are equal to zero with other values. This allows you to consider a default value (such as zero or another number) for these cases instead of generating an error.


Error Management: If you still want to throw an error, you can simply use a condition to check for the presence of zeros in B.


Improved Code
Here is an improved version of your code that uses tf.where:
    python
    
    
  
  import tensorflow as tf

# Define the tensors
A = tf.constant([[2, 2], [2, 2]], dtype=tf.int64)
B = tf.constant([[0, 0], [0, 0]], dtype=tf.int64)

def safe_floormod(A, B):
    # Check for zero in B and handle it
    if tf.reduce_any(B == 0):
        # You can either raise an error or handle it in a different way
        raise tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError(None, None, ""Integer division by zero."")
    
    return tf.math.floormod(A, B)

# Using the wrapper function
try:
    output = safe_floormod(A, B)
    print(f""Output: {output}"")
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f""Error: {e}"")

# Attempt to perform floormod on GPU
try:
    with tf.device(""/gpu:0""):
        output_gpu = tf.math.floormod(A, B)  # This will raise an error
        print(f""\nGPU output: {output_gpu}\n"")
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f""Error on GPU: {e}"")

Code Explanation


Function safe_floormod: This function first checks if there are any zeros in B. If so, it raises an InvalidArgumentError.


Error Management: By using try-except, you can manage potential errors and print an appropriate message.


Conclusion
With these changes, you can prevent errors caused by division by zero and design your code to handle cases where there are zeros in B correctly. If you have any further questions or need additional explanations, I would be happy to help!

Updates `github/codeql-action` from 3.26.10 to 3.27.0

<summary>Release notes</summary>

<h2>v3.27.0</h2>
<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>
<p>See the <a href=""https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases"">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>
<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>
<h2>3.27.0 - 22 Oct 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.6. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2549"">#2549</a></li>
<li>Fix an issue where the <code>upload-sarif</code> Action would fail with &quot;upload-sarif post-action step failed: Input required and not supplied: token&quot; when called in a composite Action that had a different set of inputs to the ones expected by the <code>upload-sarif</code> Action. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2557"">#2557</a></li>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.2. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2552"">#2552</a></li>

<h2>3.26.12 - 07 Oct 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.14.5 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 24 September 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.10, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.27.0 and later and versions 2.27.0 and later. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2520"">#2520</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.14.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.13.5 and 2.14.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.26.11</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.26.11</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</p>

<h2>3.26.11 - 03 Oct 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Upcoming breaking change</em>: Add support for using <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> to programmatically consume CodeQL Action debug artifacts.</p>
<p>Starting November 30, 2024, GitHub.com customers will <a href=""https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/"">no longer be able to use <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code></a>. Therefore, to avoid breakage, customers who programmatically download the CodeQL Action debug artifacts should set the <code>CODEQL_ACTION_ARTIFACT_V4_UPGRADE</code> environment variable to <code>true</code> and bump <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> in their workflows. The CodeQL Action will enable this behavior by default in early November and workflows that have not yet bumped to <code>actions/download-artifact@v3</code> to <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> will begin failing then.</p>
<p>This change is currently unavailable for GitHub Enterprise Server customers, as <code>actions/upload-artifact@v4</code> and <code>actions/download-artifact@v4</code> are not yet compatible with GHES.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.19.1. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2519"">#2519</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.26.10 - 30 Sep 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are rolling out a feature in September/October 2024 that sets up CodeQL using a bundle compressed with <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/zstd/"">Zstandard</a>. Our aim is to improve the performance of setting up CodeQL. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2502"">#2502</a></li>

Added gpu_b100 gpu backend for Nvidia blackwell gpu. 
Added gpu_b100 to the backends field of test targets currently tagged with gpu_a100 and/or gpu_h100 to execute them on blackwell gpus in Nvidia CI. 
We may later remove some gpu_b100 tags if we realize the test targets should not run on Blackwell.

The current behavior crashes the program whenever a nccl async error has occured, timeout errors are also not detected for async events. This pr adds a mechanism to do:
1. poll statuses of async events and return timeout if status is pending for too long
2. return nccl async event status as xla status so a proper python exception can be thrown.

2623988236,pull_request,closed,,[XLA:GPU] Add EstimateRunTimesForMultiOutputFusion.,"[XLA:GPU] Add EstimateRunTimesForMultiOutputFusion.

The current way we calculate fused time estimate for multi-output fusion is incorrect. We do `time_fused += producer_runtime.write_time` after applying latency hiding heuristic. As a result the formula for fused time look something like this:

```
time_fused = overlap_with_95_percent(compute_time, read_time + consumer_write_time) + producer_write_time
```

For a compute bound kernel the formula will likely say that the fusion is not beneficial even if it saves a lot of consumer memory read. 

In many cases current Cost Model in MultiOutputFusion gives identical costs for fused and unfused case and it's mostly luck that we proceed with beneficial fusions.

The correct formula is

```
time_fused = overlap_with_95_percent(compute_time, read_time + producer_write_time + consumer_write_time)
```

I've added a separate `EstimateRunTimesForMultiOutputFusion` to make it easier to migrate MultiOutputFusion to the same Cost Model calculation as in PriorityFusion. 

Eventually `EstimateRunTimesForMultiOutputFusion` and 
`EstimateRunTimesForPriorityFusion` will be unified in one function.

However, math function, even expensive, are not blockers for vectorization and not unrolling usually causes performance regression.

When allowing exponential op to be fused into triton fusions, the fusion that
is formed by SoftmaxRewriter will include the Exponential op as well, and on
H100 the cost model tells us it is worse to use triton for the formed fusion.
If we change the shapes a bit, triton will still be preferred.
