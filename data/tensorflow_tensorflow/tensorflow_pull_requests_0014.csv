This is not true. Concurrent access to the boolean is a data race and must be
avoided with a mutex. Thankfully, the code was already protecting access to the
variable with a mutex. This CL adds some thread annotations to double check
this.

With while loop double buffering, a simple add operation gets added to the entry computation. If a dynamic slice fusion operation exists in this case, then we should be able to evaluate this. If the value is a constant, then no extra cost is incurred because of this change.

Also, fixed the type of Offset in DynamicSliceThunk from uint64_t to int64_t. During execution we deal with int64_t, and so, it only makes sense to store it in int64_t too.

This PR adds a pass that performs common subexpression elimination on all-gathers of parameters. This is especially useful in strategies where you do not want to run all-gathers in the backward pass. 

```
    Before the pass:
    while_loop {
        all-gather.1 = all-gather(param_0)
        some_computation.1 = compute(all-gather.1)
        all-gather.2 = all-gather(param_0)
        some_computation.2 = compute(all-gather.2)
    }

    After the pass:
    while_loop {
        all-gather.0 = all-gather(param_0)
        some_computation.1 = compute(all-gather.0)

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/18838

For collective-permutes with small message sizes, it is beneficial to combine them into a single collective because
1. it gets rid of some kernel launch overhead, and allows NCCL to do some message fusion;
2. fewer collectives make it easier for LHS to make better decision.

In order to support combining collective-permutes, we need to support multi-operand collective-permute first, a.k.a. the combined collective-permute. This PR extends the existing CP interface by overloading it, so that a CP can have multiple operands.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/20294

This PR fixes the test failure. Eventually this should be addressed in cuBLAS, as the similar test ""NonstandardLayoutInt4WithManyNonContractingDimsReversedLayout"" passes, so the ""NonstandardLayoutInt4WithManyNonContractingDims"" should pass too.

We previously hard-coded threads-per-warp on ROCm to 32.

Then in https://github.com/openxla/xla/commit/53417984a9baf80ac9b677f13e628867298f8eae I changed ROCm to query the hip runtime for this property.

However, this seems to have broken AMD's CI so I am restoring the old behavior.

This is probably wrong but things are currently broken and reverting back to the prior behavior leaves things less broken.

An empty original value is accepted by `ParseOriginalValue` with syntax like
`origin={}`, but converting that value back to a string fails because it
attempts to read a disengaged optional from the `ShapeTree`. Let's ensure the
round-trip works properly.

A fuller fix would be to look at the semantics of whether such values should
be accepted, but the interest of preventing crashes quickly we'll start with
this.

Doing this through the constructor also allows the size of the readahead buffer to be changed, which is not possible with the existing API unless we use the long version of the constructor which has 10 parameters. There is also a `ResetFileBlockCache`, but it only modifies the size of the file cache, not the size readahead buffer.

While it is possible to set that with environment variables, those variables are global and would modify the behaviour of all GCS clients. Allowing the override through the constructor would allow more control over how those overrides happen.

This change introduces a new `PreprocessModuleForTestRunner` virtual method with
an empty default implementation. The idea is to invoke this on on a module
intended to be run with the designated test runner, applying a set of default
module transforms for compatibility.

The transforms are specific to the runner being used, so the test base class
implementation is best suited to specifying these transforms (or not specifying
them if not required).

2721545073,pull_request,closed,,Add option for `HloRunnerPjRt` to forward parameter layout for on device use.,"Add option for `HloRunnerPjRt` to forward parameter layout for on device use.

I encountered some tests that rely on the on-device layout matching the
parameter layout in the entry computation shape of the module.

#1267 introduced logic to the `HloRunner` which changes the on-device shape to
""favor [the] entry computation shape with some adjustment"". Subsequently, tests
were written against this behavior.

This logic roughly does the following for each parameter:

- The parameter shape is converted using the `device_shape_representation_fn_`.
- For each subshape, if an array:
  - Extract the equivalent subshape from the entry computation shape.
  - If the subshape is static and has tiling info
    - Overwrite the subshape with the equivalent subshape.

It has the effect of attaching the layout info from the ECL, which matters in
many of our tests.

`HloRunnerPjRt` does not appear to have equivalent logic that does this. The
`PjRtClient` API for `BufferFromHostLiteral` lets us optionally override the
on-device layout. This PR allows a user to enable
`use_parameter_layout_on_device` and have the `HloRunnerPjRt` pass the
`parameter_layout` as a `device_layout`.

This CL introduces a new `GetAliveTasks` RPC to the multi-controller JAX
coordination service. For a set of tasks `T`, `GetAliveTasks(T)` returns the
subset `A` of healthy tasks in `T`. To avoid hosts from disagreeing on which
tasks are healthy, `GetAliveTasks` has barrier-like semantics. In particular,
`GetAliveTasks` returns `A` only after every task in `A` has called
`GetAliveTasks(T)`. This API is intended to enable fault tolerant training
using multi-controller JAX.

Note that this CL introduces the `GetAliveTasks` API but it is not yet used. In
future CLs, I will pipe the API through to JAX and expose a `jax.alive_devices`
API. I'm separating the CLs to make the code easier to review.

# Implementation Details

`GetAliveTasks` has barrier-like semantics, and the coordination service
already implements barriers. However, the implementation of `GetAliveTasks`
differs from the barrier implementation in a couple of ways.

First, the barrier API expects a unique barrier name. For example, you might
call `barrier(""foo"")` to block on the barrier named ""foo"". For ergonomics,
`GetAliveTasks` does not require barrier names. Instead, the set of tasks
passed to `GetAliveTasks` acts like a name.

Second, the barrier API requires every barrier to have a unique name. It would
be annoying to construct a new name for every single barrier. Instead, the
barrier API allows programmers to repeatedly block on the same barrier.  To
implement this, every barrier has not only a name, but also a counter. For
example, you might request to block on the ""foo.0"" barrier or the ""bar.4""
barrier. Coordination service clients keep track of the latest counter value to
use, incrementing it after every successful barrier. There is also some logic
surrounding how a failed client can recover the latest counter value.

Third, the barrier API allows barrier calls to time out. This means that a
barrier can enter a failed state, and all future entrants to the barrier should
observe this failed state. This introduces some complexity to the API, as
barrier state must be maintained even after the barrier has failed. The
`GetAliveTasks` does not implement timeouts and currently, a barrier cannot
fail. We can augment the API in the future if needed.

However, I would argue that the simpler semantics are sufficient, as there are
other sources of odd failure behavior in existing multi-controller JAX
programs. For example, if some tasks enter a collective and time out, while
other tasks enter the collective later, the program may hang or fail. Thus,
having stronger `GetAliveTasks` semantics increases the complexity of the API
without making multi-controller JAX programs meaningfully more fault tolerant.

`xla::Compiler` manages instances of `Compiler` that are registered statically.

`StreamExecutorGpuClient` used to get its `Compiler` instance during static initialization which might fail if the `Compiler` instance gets registered later.

As a fix we will get the needed `Compiler` instance during every compilation call.

The transformation is provided as a lambda to MSA. It applies to all instructions inside non-fusion computations that are not converted to async and their inputs are not in alternate memory:
1) Is allowed to mark a set of instruction for removal
2) Is allowed to change existing instructions of the graph
3) Is NOT allowed to add new instructions to the graph
(note: It is up to the transformation to make sure that changes to the graph are semantics-preserving.)

The lambda then returns a struct containing the set of to be deleted instructions and a map of old HloUse to new HloUse. This map is used to fix the allocation sequence in MSA after the transformation runs.

Profiling shows that `FuncGraph.as_default()` takes approximately 60us per call, much of which is in reevaluating the `@tf_contextlib.contextmanager` decorator on the local function. We can hoist this out to a top-level function. and pass captures explicitly, to ensure we pay this cost only once.

Notes:
- Add public `RunHeuristicSolver()` executor function.
- Add `SolveTrivial()` baseline that assigns all nodes to their first sharding strategy. If infeasible (e.g., violated the peak-memory constraint), output a negative cost encoding the violation code.
