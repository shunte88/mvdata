Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/18595

Let us verify that all the devices to run a PJRT executable are compatible with the device that was used to build the executable. Currently we only verify the compatibility on each device separately, just before running the executable on the device.

This fixes a problem where running an executable with a collective on two different devices crashes on NCCL timeout. When only one of the device will not pass the compatibility check while the other device (the one passes the check) runs, the running device will hang on the NCCL collective (since the incompatible device program has not been executed).

[GPU] Horizontal loop fusion: remove layout check.

The check as it's written doesn't prevent uncoalesced access as it
intends but does prevent some reasonable fusions.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/18765

In late optimizations, while loop analysis was unable to handle the fused operations, primarily for `GetLoopInductionVariableIndex` and `ComputeWhileLoopTripCount`. This patch handles that. 

Summary of the changes:

  * Enhanced `GetGTEOperandIndex` to `GetUniqueGTEDependenceIndex`
  * When brute-forcing the trip count, we want to evaluate the operations recursively instead of just evaluating the operation at hand.

Note: This PR also has the HloEvaluator changes from #18563 as they are required for this to work. After that PR gets merged, I will rebase this for a clean merge.

A `GraphConditional` represents a conditional in a command buffer and is an opaque handle that can be passed to set-condition kernels. (A set-condition kernel sets the value of the conditional based on whether the associated nested commmand buffer should be executed or not.)

2619163946,pull_request,open,,Make TritonSupportTest surface sanitizer issues,"Make TritonSupportTest surface sanitizer issues

TritonSupportTest relies on a death test for some of its assertion because Triton doesn't allow graceful error handling for some of the cases we want to test.

This death test also used to succeed when the code under test triggered a santizer violation.

So this change makes it fail on those sanitizer violations and will be surface those in the log.

Ideally we would tightly control in which code path each death test terminates, but unfortunately most of them don't have indicative error message. Some just call `std::abort` without an error message. Some just die in accessing an empty `std::optional`, etc. So the best we can do is make sure that we detect sanitizer errors and report these as test failures.

2618482714,pull_request,closed,,[XLA:GPU] Only cache fusible instructions in FusionDeduplicationCache.,"[XLA:GPU] Only cache fusible instructions in FusionDeduplicationCache.

This is an optimization of compile time. `deduplicated_id_map` in `FusionDeduplicationCache::Create` uses `HloInstruction::Identical` to compare instructions that have identical hash. There are not that many comparisons need to happen and they're usually very fast, but there is a one particular patter that causes problems:

```
some_tuple = (f32[10], f32[10], ...) tuple(...)
gte0 = get-tuple-element(some_tuple), index=0
gte1 = get-tuple-element(some_tuple), index=1
```

`gte0` and `gte1` have the same hash, so they need to be compared with `HloInstruction::Identical`. Due to the generic implementation of `Identical`, operands will be compared first. It can happen that the tuple `some_tuple` has thousand of element. In that case `Shape::Equal` takes a lot of time.

Since `get-tuple-element` can't be part of a fusion itself, there is no point to get cache entries for instructions that are not fusible.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/18766

## Issue:
When running TE using XLA with xla_gpu_determinisitc_ops=true, the prefix scan inside the scatter determinism expander caused segfault when then there is only one update in the scatter operation. 
### Steps to reproduce:
```
docker run -it --rm --ipc=host --gpus=all ghcr.io/nvidia/jax:pax-2024-10-18
cd /opt/transformer-engine
pip install -r ./examples/jax/encoder/requirements.txt
XLA_FLAGS=""${XLA_FLAGS} --xla_gpu_deterministic_ops"" pytest examples/jax/encoder/test_single_gpu_encoder.py
```

The scatter determinism expander assumed the original scatter operation is not deterministic, meaning the case where there is only one index-update pair is not possible. However, if the creator of the scatter operation did not mark the scatter operation to have unique_indices, the scatter determinism expander pass will still match and be applied. In this case, the prefix scan implementation will have a segfault because the log2ceiling of num_indices=1 is 0, leading to direct return in the prefix scan without getting into the loop body, and hence a nullptr update will be returned.

## Changes:
1. Modified the implementation of pattern matching of scatter_determinism_expander, so that even if the unique_indices flag of the scatter operation is not set properly, we will still check the number of indices to make sure the pass is not applied on the scatter with one index.
2. Modified the implementation of prefix scan so that even if the loop body is not entered, the correct update will be returned.
3. Added checks before final CreateScatter operation to explicitly check if any args of the new scatter operation is nullptr. After this, even if any args is nullptr, the pass will fail explicitly instead of having a segfault.
4. Added a test for the case where there is only one index-update pair, and make sure the scatter_determinism_expander pass does not match in this case.

This PR is the 2nd step (out of 2) to improve the performance of deterministic scatter. Originally, the scatter op will be expanded to be deterministic in xla/service/ScatterExpander.cc. However, since it took a while-loop-based approach, the performance is extremely poor. We designed and implemented a prefix-scan-based approach to rewrite the scatter operation to be an efficient deterministic scatter. This PR completes the optimization of deterministic scatter operations with non-scalar indices and updates.

pky00 (Issue Creator) on (2024-10-27 17:46:27 UTC): When using the keras imported from tensorflow `tensorflow.keras` , keras doesnt get linted because keras is dynamically imported, making developing much harder. Adding the keras module statically only when type checking enables linting making development easier.

mihaimaruseac on (2024-10-28 09:16:56 UTC): But now keras will no longer be lazily imported, I think?

Can you open an issue on tf-keras repo and have some discussion there first, please?

As in HloModule::RemoveUnusedComputations, we can simply perform a DFS over the computations both to find used computations and to trigger RunOnComputation on any used computations. We then remove all unreachable computations.

This improves over the existing code because we avoid repeatedly calling HloModule::MakeComputationPostOrder(), each call to which requires traversing every instruction in every computation. Instead, we can perform a single traversal of the computations.

The `ScopedGpuGraphExec` type is an RAII wrapper that changes the executable graph handle of a nested command buffer to a given value and restores it to its old value during destruction.

It's needed to handle updates of an existing executable graph. Since nested command buffers don't have their own executable graph this wrapper helps with making the executable graph of the root command buffer available to its nested command buffers.

This change makes all of this happen in platform specific sublasses by providing an pure virtual function declaration `ActivateScopedGpuGraphExec` which returns a unique pointer to a base class of the RAII wrapper.

2612432600,pull_request,closed,,"Use synchronized initialization feature (as opposed to connect, then sync).","Use synchronized initialization feature (as opposed to connect, then sync).

---

Consider this error pattern (before this CL):
1) 4 slice McJax workload is scheduled on Cloud GKE.
2) Slice 0, 1, 2's TPU hosts invoke `jax.distributed.initialize()`.
3) Everyone is still waiting for slice 3.
4) Slice 1 crashes due to a transient GKE error (e.g. maintenance event).
5) Because slice 1 goes away unexpectedly, slice 0's service panics. The service is stopped. **Slice 0 and slice 2 goes down** because of the service crash.

---

**The restarts in the last step are unnecessary, and cause additional scheduling overhead.** With the synchronized initialization feature, we allow TPU hosts to restart and join again silently WITHOUT causing the entire cluster to crash. At this point, no meaningful Jax program has run yet, so silent restarts are harmless.

Restarts should only cause the entire cluster to crash AFTER init, where cluster restart is the only way to recover from a possibly inconsistent state.

---

This has a few benefits:
* Simplify state changes during init to be all-or-nothing op: Nobody will send heartbeat until everybody in the cluster has acked. That's less error flows to reason about during init.

* This helps with consistent in-sync restarts. There's no weird staggering / cascading restart flows regardless of what the scheduler does.

* Move business logic into coord service (pjrt/distributed as simple wrapper).
