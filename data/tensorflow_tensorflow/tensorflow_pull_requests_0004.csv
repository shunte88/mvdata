As reported in https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/issues/25808, the performance of XLA's CPU FFT is dramatically reduced with the thunks runtime. This is because the intra-op thread pool wasn't properly passed through. This change adds multithreading support, by passing through the thread pool provided by xla::ExecuteParams, but I don't know if this is the right approach.

This brings down the ""cognitive complexity"" of the function from 78 to 60.

I am working on adding TMA support to EmitMatmul, but this function is cannot support it the way it is currently written. EmitMatmul assumes that each input can be easily translated to an iterable argument, which is not the case for TMA where we are iterating over 2 indices rather than a tensor pointer.

Previously, the function relied on multiple iter_arg_to-* functions. This change refactors the code to enclose each input that needs to be emitted on each iteration of the ForOp into its own class. This can further be abstracted to fully emit the parameter value & calculate indices next.

Previously, there were many different index calculations happening here & I tried to abstract them to be named in order for it to be more legible.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/20155

This is the last PR needed to enable the explicit stream annotation feature.

This PR enables the IR emitter for kCall subroutines that are wrapped in async-{start,done} pairs. For start, the instructions in the kCall are converted to a `SequentialThunk`. This thunk and the inner thunks are then annotated with their respective `execution_stream_ids`. (These ids come from #19699)

The order of evaluating function arguments is unspecified ([ref](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/eval_order)), so pjrt_executable would get released first, leading to seg faults.

This caused the following test failures:
- all_reduce_test
- broadcast_test
- gather_operation_test

This completes the lowerings of the existing ops, plus adds
the following ops and their lowerings:

- xla_cpu.success to set a ""success"" !xla_cpu.error. We'll
  probably add a xla_cpu.set_error op in the future.
- xla_cpu.thread_id to read the program's thread id.

Note that we switch to the greedy pattern rewriter. I also tried
the walk pattern rewriter, but it doesn't work well in this case
because we rewrite the function signatures, and we end up polluting
the IR by casting back and forth between !xla_cpu.call_frame and
!llvm.ptr.

This tool runs specified matrix shapes and datatypes (HLO dots) on given hardware and
saves clock cycles for each. Matrix shapes can be specified by defining a search space.

Assume matrix multiplication dims: [n,k] @ [k,m] -> [n,m].

The specification has a format

{m,n,k}_spec='start=<start>,stop=<stop>,step=<step>'

Which means for a particular spec we will generate a set
  {<start> + n * <step> | n * <step> <= <stop> - <start> for every n w/ {0}}

Program expects a spec for every dim. The generated matrix multplication shapes
are a cartesian product of these three specs (+ specified data types).

Usage:

1. Run cartesian product for
  shape:{256x256x256} x dtype:{bf16,bf16->bf16 and bf16,bf16->f32} and dump to proto.

2809030851,pull_request,open,,Add synchronization barrier for CUDA host callbacks to allow TSAN to run,"Add synchronization barrier for CUDA host callbacks to allow TSAN to run

CUDA stream host callbacks are getting executed from a CUDA-managed
thread pool. Calling `cuStreamSynchronize` blocks until the
stream has finished executing all its operations including the host
callbacks.

Unfortunately thread sanitizer can't identify `cuStreamSynchronize`
as a synchronization barrier between a memory write in a host
callback and a memory read on the main thread. This is because
the CUDA libraries are not instrumented for thread sanitizer and
don't use a synchronization mechanism that could be intercepted
(they probably use some variation of atomics, maybe some handrolled
futex implementation; pthread mutexes would have been fine).

So this change is adding an explicit synchronization barrier in
the form of a mutex to `CUDAStream`. This of course has some
unnecessary overheard but being able to run thread sanitizer is
a huge advantage so that in my opinion it's worth it.

The implementation uses an atomic integer paired with a mutex
protected predicate. I've also tried a simpler implementation
that just uses a mutex but that's roughly 3% slower.

It's also possible to hide the additional lock behind a
`#ifdef THREAD_SANITIZER` but I rather keep the more complex
implementation than making the sanitizer code path execute
different code.

XLA needs to set LLVM's global command line option flags in a some
places to influence settings in the compilation pipeline.

Since writing or reading these command line flags is not thread-safe
and global we have a process-wide lock `LLVMCommandLineOptionsLock`
which manages multiple LLVM users with different flags in the
same process.

Turns out the lock was not correctly in place for our LLVM IR
emitter code path. This led to a race condition which potentially affected
users that compile multiple modules in parallel from different threads.

So this change fixes that and also adds a test that should light up
when running under TSAN if the compilation pipeline becomes non-thread-safe
in the future.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/21391

xla_gpu_disable_async_collectives accepts a list of collective names, to be more efficient, we add a ""ALLCOLLECTIVE"" option to the enum so we can disable all ops with a single element.
