Previously, the IR emitter relied on the channel ID to determine the async events key for partially pipelined async collectives.
The channel ID was used in a misleading way. Generally, it is supposed to be unique per op, which would cause breakage here.
As a result this use of channel ID caused many special cases in the verifier and also in the emitter.

Expose a predicate function interface through dot merger to pass in backend-specific compatibility check.
This is used in gpu compiler to avoid merging dots that are assigned with 2 different non-default stream ids as they will be optimized separately.

jagiella (Issue Creator) on (2024-11-21 16:54:29 UTC): But the proposed patch does not change what is compiled into the shared library. It only changes which symbols are exposed to the linker. 

*Remaining questions:*
1. If separate libraries for tflite and gpu delegate are prefered, why is the GPU delegate code compiled into the static tflite library (cmake target = tensorflow-lite) in the first place?

2. If separate libraries for tflite and gpu delegate are prefered, shouldn't there be a cmake build configuration for building the GPU (and other) delegate libraries provided by the repository analogously to the tensorflowlite_c library?

fergushenderson on (2024-11-21 18:45:52 UTC): Well, the ""--whole-archive"" flag will change what gets linked into the shared library.


For our binary distributions on Android, we have separate Maven packages -- and hence also separate `.so` libraries -- for TFLite and the GPU delegate, both for regular TF Lite and also for TF Lite in Play services.  And we have a separate library target for the Bazel build.
<https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0aa5275dd158353b6cbf2520830a44791f37abdd/tensorflow/lite/delegates/gpu/BUILD#L191>
I am also not aware of any _compelling_ reasons to prefer having a single shared library with both.  So for consistency, I do think it makes sense to have separate shared libraries with the CMake build too.  But I might be missing something... if so, please let me know.


That's a good question.  I don't know why it was done that way originally.


IMHO: Yes, that sounds right to me.

jagiella (Issue Creator) on (2024-11-22 08:57:38 UTC): Although I very much agree with your concern of feature parity between the c++ and c library set(s), would you still consider including the patch in the meanwhile to provide access to the delegates for cmake users until a proper cmake route is established for building the standalone delegate libraries? :angel: 

For now, everything is laying in front of us, but is just not usable without every user willing to use it needing to create its own individual patch / solution by him/herself :smile: And thats a pity kind of.

fergushenderson on (2024-11-22 10:31:50 UTC): Can you use the prebuilt Maven packages, rather than building from sources?

The GPU package should define symbols that are sufficient to allow you to use the GPU delegate, possibly with minor source code changes to your app in terms of exactly how you construct the GPU delegate object, depending on exactly which API you are using to do that currently.

jagiella (Issue Creator) on (2024-11-22 14:37:45 UTC): We require both, tflite and delegates, for debian based systems with amd64 and embedded arm64 CPUs. That's what we currently build or crosscompile the library for. Maven sounds more like mobile applications.

fergushenderson on (2024-11-27 15:17:54 UTC): Unfortunately I think doing that would not be a good idea, because once the GPU delegate symbols are exposed in the `tensorflowlite_c.so` library, people will start to write code that depends on those symbols, and then removing those symbols from that library would then become problematic because it would not be backwards compatible and would break that code.

jagiella (Issue Creator) on (2024-11-27 20:19:32 UTC): I fully understand the backward compatibility trap and agree that this is not desired, if separate libraries are the way to go in the long run.

I just do not know how to build the delegate libraries. I couldn't find any documentation or tutorial on the matter. The comment https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/55624#issuecomment-1106491140 mentions how to use them, but not how to build them. Or am I missing something?

fergushenderson on (2024-11-27 21:13:14 UTC): Have a look at the BUILD files, which contain the Bazel build rules.
In particular 
[delegates/gpu/BUILD line 191](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/91d661ed50ef1de336cb04d34ae8391aecdceea5/tensorflow/lite/delegates/gpu/BUILD#L191)
is the rule for building the `.so` file that contains the GPU delegate.

Maybe even ask Gemini to translate that Bazel build rule to a CMake configuration?

jagiella (Issue Creator) on (2024-11-27 21:39:06 UTC): but looking at the tensorflow/lite/CMakeLists.txt file for the tflite c++ library https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/91d661ed50ef1de336cb04d34ae8391aecdceea5/tensorflow/lite/CMakeLists.txt#L652-L713 it contadicts what you stated before: It clearly adds the delegate source files (`TFLITE_DELEGATES_GPU_SRCS`) to the tflite sources (`_ALL_TFLITE_SRCS`) which are going to be compiled into one single libtensorflowlite.so.

So enabling GPU delegate support as described in the cmake build documentation https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/tensorflow/+/6b511124eb0/tensorflow/lite/g3doc/guide/build_cmake.md#opencl-gpu-delegate, e.g.
```bash
cmake ../tensorflow_src/tensorflow/lite -DTFLITE_ENABLE_GPU=ON
```
will result in a tflite library with delegate support ""baked"" into the library without the need of an additional delegate plugin library to use the enabled delegates. That somehow does not match, what you said about the c++ tflite library earlier. 

Maybe for the bazel build pipeline that separation / modularization was done, but for cmake it follows a monolithic approach.

fergushenderson on (2025-01-21 05:24:34 UTC): I agree that things are currently not consistent between CMake and Bazel build systems.

But I think the proposed changes in this PR make things worse, rather than reducing this inconsistency. I think separate libraries for each delegate are preferable in the long run, rather than a single monolithic library.

And because this PR would expose new ABIs, backwards compatibility concerns would make it difficult to fix later.

So I don't think we should go ahead with this.
Instead, I think we should migrate the current CMake build support for a monolithic library with optional support for GPU delegate to instead use separate libraries.

Introduces `jax.config.array_garbage_collection_guard`, which is a tristate config for setting up a `jax.Array` garbage collection guard. The possible configs are:
* allow: `jax.Array`s are allowed to be garbage collected. This is the default value.
* log: whenever a `jax.Array` is GCed a log entry is generated with the array's traceback.
* fatal: fatal crash when a `jax.Array` is GCed. This is meant to be used for mature code bases that do tight memory management, and are reference cycle free.

Previously, we would assume that an uncoalesced write would always waste all

elements are loaded ""without waste"", and how many elements actually are wasted
when loading a tile.

Then, we compute a percentage of effective bandwidth utilization out of that.
For now, this is used to compute `WriteTime` only, but an upcoming change will
also use it to compute `ReadTime`.

2571868397,pull_request,closed,,[HLO Componentization] Refactoring hlo_test_base for Hardware Independence,"[HLO Componentization] Refactoring hlo_test_base for Hardware Independence

We propose refactoring :hlo_test_base testing target in the XLA compiler to separate its hardware-agnostic and hardware-specific APIs. This will enable the migration of hardware-agnostic HLO transformation passes and their tests to a dedicated sub-component, promoting modularity and maintainability.

The target is proposed to be split into:

1. :hlo_hardware_independent_test_base (HWI): This new target will contain all the existing
                                HWI APIs from :hlo_test_base and will reside
                                within the HLO component.

2. :hlo_test_base (HWS): This target will retain its current location and
                         functionality, including the HWS APIs. Crucially, it
                         will be built on top of :hlo_static_test_base,
                         inheriting the HWI APIs.

With this in mind, it's probably good to support the use of these types for specifying array attributes. This is one approach for doing that.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/17814

This PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/11880 created a latent bug on ROCM side which was really hard to track. 
Due to [gemm_algorithm_picker](https://github.com/ROCm/xla/blob/58cd0e78dc19075e7c935d7cdb31676ce868e64c/xla/service/gpu/autotuning/gemm_algorithm_picker.cc#L299), the problem occurs only for non-zero beta when the output matrix is large enough (so it cannot be filled with two first runs). This results in buffer comparator errors like:

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15577

With the existing `enable_mock_nccl` setting it is impossible to warm up compilation cache when there are multiple processes per node. This is because the cache key includes topology and GPU topology contains information about number of slices and number of hosts per slice. The current mocking of topologies always sets num_hosts_per_slice to 1. However, if you have multiple GPUs on a node and run a process-per-GPU then num_hosts_per_slice must be set to the number of GPUs.

This patch allows setting num_hosts_per_slice explicitly when creating the GPU client.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/17814

This PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/11880 created a latent bug on ROCM side which was really hard to track. 
Due to [gemm_algorithm_picker](https://github.com/ROCm/xla/blob/58cd0e78dc19075e7c935d7cdb31676ce868e64c/xla/service/gpu/autotuning/gemm_algorithm_picker.cc#L299), the problem occurs only for non-zero beta when the output matrix is large enough (so it cannot be filled with two first runs). This results in buffer comparator errors like:

This is a pure refactoring, and doesn't intend to change any behavior.

It is done in preparation to change how AUTO LayoutMode is encoded in HLO (not StableHLO/MLIR).
- Original idea was that HLO would have frontend attributes that mirror StableHLO layout attributes, but actually those frontend attributes are never populated, and there is only one place in the code that read them.
- All other paths (e.g. PjRT) don't support AUTO layout and always reset it to the default.

The plan (in the follow up change) is to:
- Introduce two ""new"" ways to fetch layout mode from the HLO:
    * ""unset layout means default"" -- that the current behavior in most APIs.
    * ""unset layout means auto"" -- this is the current behavior inside XLA.
- In PjRT (and potentially other APIs), change ""unset means default"" to ""unset means auto"", likely behind the flag.
- Likely remove the remaining piece of code that reads frontend attributes to determine the layout mode.

cuBLAS do support dot_bf16_bf16_f32 algorithm but only on Ampere.
Lets simulate the behaviour on ampere and hopper.

We could do that by replacing dot+dot_bf16_bf16_f32 with convert to bf16 + dot without algorithm. It makes sense to do that for both, ampere and hopper because in both case convert + dot is faster. At the same time there is no guarantees are made by cublas to actually use BF16 for either A100 or H100. The explicit cast enforces that.
