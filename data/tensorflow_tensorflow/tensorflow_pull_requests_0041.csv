nehalmr (Issue Creator) on (2024-07-31 20:09:39 UTC): ## Title: Add CUDA and cuDNN Configuration to TensorFlow WORKSPACE

**Description:**
This pull request addresses issue [#72879](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/72879), where TensorFlow fails to find the CUDA compiler with the error Could not find compiler for platform CUDA: NOT_FOUND. The updates ensure TensorFlow's build configuration correctly includes CUDA and cuDNN support and provides a script to verify the CUDA setup.

**Files Changed:**

tensorflow/WORKSPACE
tensorflow/tools/ci_build/gpu_build.sh (new script)
**Changes Made**:

Updated WORKSPACE file: Added repository configurations for CUDA and cuDNN to ensure they are included in the TensorFlow build system.
Added gpu_build.sh script: This script sets the necessary environment variables and verifies the CUDA installation and nvcc compiler.

**Instructions to Test:**

Update the WORKSPACE File: Apply the changes to include CUDA and cuDNN configurations.
Run the Verification Script: Execute gpu_build.sh to confirm that CUDA and nvcc are correctly set up.
Build TensorFlow: Follow the standard build instructions to ensure CUDA support is integrated properly.
Additional Notes:

This pull request aims to resolve the compilation issue reported in [#72879](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/72879) by ensuring TensorFlow can correctly locate and use the CUDA compiler.
Ensure that the CUDA version specified (12.2) matches your installation.

nehalmr (Issue Creator) on (2024-08-01 19:46:13 UTC): @eyalhir74 Thanks for Query, Solution: 
# 1. Install cuDNN
You can download and install cuDNN from the NVIDIA website. Make sure to select the version that matches your CUDA version (12.2 in this case).

```bash

# Assuming you have downloaded the cuDNN tar file
tar -xzvf cudnn-linux-x86_64-8.x.x.x_cuda12-archive.tar.xz
sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda-12.2/include
sudo cp -P cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda-12.2/lib64
sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda-12.2/include/cudnn*.h /usr/local/cuda-12.2/lib64/libcudnn*
```

# 2. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure the environment variables are correctly pointing to the CUDA and cuDNN directories.

```bash

export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.2
export CUDNN_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/cuda-12.2/include
export CUDNN_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/cuda-12.2/lib64

export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$CUDNN_LIB_DIR:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Steps to Test
1) Install cuDNN:
Follow the steps to install cuDNN and ensure it is in the correct directory.

2) Set Environment Variables:
Make sure the environment variables point to the correct locations for CUDA and cuDNN.

3) Update WORKSPACE File:
Ensure the paths in the WORKSPACE file are correct.

4) Run the Verification Script:
Execute gpu_build.sh to verify that both CUDA and cuDNN are properly set up.

5) Build TensorFlow:
Follow the standard TensorFlow build instructions.

1. Remove IsIdle() method, which was only called during destruction in favor of calling the underlying code during the actual destructor.
2. Remove Destroy(), which was only called in the DeallocateStream which was only called in the destructor.  Instead, just call the code in the destructor.
3. Make Init() return an absl::Status.
4. Just pass the priority std::optional to the constructor rather than have discrete SetPriority methods taking either of the choices.

This can be disabled with the flag --xla_gpu_mlir_emitter_level, setting it to

Change some tests to still use the old emitters. We have separate IR tests for
the new emitters, and keeping the old tests running with the old emitters ensures
we still have coverage for the old emitters, in case we need to rollback.
One notable change with enabling emitter level 4 is that the heuristic to avoid
code duplication due to cache invalidation is disabled. This was always a
a workaround, and the new emitters fixed the problem. This is the most common
source of why the tests behave differently between the old and the new emitters.

### An simple example

Let us take the following dot as an example.
```
lhs = bf16[16384,2048] parameter(0), sharding={devices=[16,8]<=[128]}
rhs = bf16[16384,256] parameter(1), sharding={devices=[128,1]<=[128]}
ROOT dot = bf16[2048,256] dot(lhs, rhs), lhs_contracting_dims={0}, rhs_contracting_dims={0}, sharding={devices=[8,1,16]<=[16,8]T(1,0) last_tile_dim_replicate}
```
A good solution is to reshard rhs into `sharding={devices=[16,1,8]<=[128] last_tile_dim_replicate}`. In this way, all three tensors have matched shardings. The partitioner can convert it into dot operation and an all-reduce.

Before this cl, the partitioner is suboptimal. It reshards the rhs twice
```
{devices=[128,1]<=[128]} -> replicated -> {devices=[16,1,8]<=[128] last_tile_dim_replicate}
```
It is redundant to fully rematerialize rhs.

This cl reshards `rhs` directly from `{devices=[128,1]<=[128]}` to `{devices=[16,1,8]<=[128] last_tile_dim_replicate}`.

### Mechanism
Let us use notation `C = dot(A, B)`. When we find that A and C has matched sharding axes along non-contracting dimensions, we intend to remove these matched axes from B. Before this cl, if the removal fails, we replicate B directly. This cl attempts to reshard B to the expected sharding, which is no worse than the last resort (replicated sharding).

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15490

Add bandwidth data for Blackwell in the collective model (the actual numbers are unknown at this point, so just copied from Hopper).
Note that ""kLowLatencyMaxBandwidths"" value for Hopper was incorrect - fixed it.

Additionally, if nvml doesn't support the card, return ""unsupported"" instead of CHECK-failing.

There is no test because I didn't find a way to trigger nondeterminism with current cuDNN.

No changes are expected in behavior of flash attention, it's only updated here because it uses the common CudnnGraph::Prepare().

This improves the achieved throughput of D2H transfers, for example when checkpointing. For example, there is a ~2x improvement in throughput of overlapped D2H copies from 8xH100 on a DGX node.

Notes:
- `TENSORFLOW_USE_NUMA` is set unconditionally instead of being hidden behind an option; it's not clear from OSS-world if this is an important handle for Google internally.
- `stream_executor::StreamExecutor::HostMemoryDeallocate` now takes the allocation size; all call sites updated. This is required by the `tsl::port::NUMAFree` API.

This PR is follow up to https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/12537#discussion_r1609449939

Request from Benjamin was to separate tests in 3 parts :

1) Just pattern matching test
2) Numerical correctness test ( run onednn$softmax and HLO pattern without fusing and check accuracy)
3) Test to make sure the OneDnnOpsRewriter is run when we call whole CPU compilation pipeline (Need to check with Benjamin regarding this)

We already had 1 covered in previously merged softmax [PR](https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/12537), this PR will address 2.
For 3, need some feedback/guidance on how to test the pipeline.

Hello!

We're updating jax version (v0.4.28) in our [MLIR based compiler](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/). However, our CI/CD process failed when building `mlir-hlo-opt` (please see [this Github Action](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst/actions/runs/10113602669/job/27970370343?pr=931)). We’ve tested the build both locally and on an AWS instance without encountering the error. The main difference is that local and aws environments build `mlir-hlo-opt` in parallel, while the CI/CD runner only uses a single core. We believe this issue is similar to a previous PR ([#61071](https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/3857)), where building with a single core fails to resolve a missing dependency. Thank you very much.

**Description of the Change:** This patch adds `PassesIncGen` as a dependency to `ChloPasses`. Otherwise, single-core build would fail because it cannot find `stablehlo/transforms/Passes.h.inc`.

**Related GitHub Issues:** Similar to https://github.com/tensorflow/mlir-hlo/issues/68.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15470

Name uniquer [guarantees](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/4228782cc8ecaa8411e988bae08aa9251507e8e9/xla/service/name_uniquer.h#L30) to return distinct names but currently does not. For the sequence of inputs like the one added in the test (a__1, a, a) it will currently return a__1, a, a__1, the last output being a duplicate of the first one. This breaks GPU kernel binary caching.

[This](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/4228782cc8ecaa8411e988bae08aa9251507e8e9/xla/service/name_uniquer.cc#L80-L96) code tries to detect the separator, which by default is ""__"", double underscore, in the input string and split the input string into root and suffix, for a__1 that should be a and 1. But because the code assumes the separator length to be 1, and even the default separator has length 2, this probably almost never works. As a result in a__1 further [atoi](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/4228782cc8ecaa8411e988bae08aa9251507e8e9/xla/service/name_uniquer.cc#L88) tries to parse ""_1"" instead of ""1"" and fails. This leads to incorrect [registration of names](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/4228782cc8ecaa8411e988bae08aa9251507e8e9/xla/service/name_uniquer.cc#L98-L99) in the end.

The fix is to simply take the actual separator string length instead of 1.

Currently it assumes that a DUS can always be emitted in-place. With recent
refactorings it becomes possible to check almost all conditions for whether a
DUS fusion can be done in-place (the only missing piece is to check whether the
buffer is shared between DUS operand and DUS output). In order for this to work
correctly also for FusionAdaptors which are ProducerConsumer fusions, we need
to work with HloInstructionAdaptor instead of HloInstruction.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15303

A previous PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15170 adds a python binding for accessing the profiled instruction.

Actually the API previously added contains repeated logic with `get_fdo_profile`, which works very similar as the added `get_instructions_profile`. The only difference is that `get_fdo_profile` writes to a string.

In essense, we only need to parse the proto to Python objects, if users really want to do so. 

This PR also adds a GPU test for the new API.

When instantiating a function and running `MlirFunctionOptimizationPass`, the `GraphDefImporter` leverages `StackTraceWrapper` to get the location of individual graph nodes. The intermediate stack trace could lead to significant host RAM usage when cached in memory, e.g., 35+G in [this experiment](https://screenshot.googleplex.com/6pZVnTAhrHRvNmZ).

With this change, the MLIR importer invokes `ToUncachedFrame` and the frames are discarded after the call. This is recovering an old behavior that was previously deleted in cl/539480407.
