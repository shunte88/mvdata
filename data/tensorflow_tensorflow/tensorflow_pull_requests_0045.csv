Let us take `C with S3 = add(A with S1, B with S2)` as an example, where `A, B, C` are tensors, `S1, S2, S3` are their shardings.

Before this change, we always have
```
A with S3 = reshard(A with S1, new_sharding=S3)
B with S3 = reshard(B with S2, new_sharding=S3)
C with S3 = add(A with S3, B with S3)
```

With this cl, if S1 and S2 are the same, we will have
```
C with S1 = add(A with S1, B with S1)
C with S3 = reshard(C with S1)
```
The new partitioning method can reduce the number of reshards.

Additional mod simplification was a coincidence due to refactoring the
sum-splitting logic. I can factor this out into a separate CL if desired.

- enables additional vectorization when there is a
  constraint on the loop symbol that is redundant.
- fixes some inconsistencies in div/mod simplification (should
  lead to better code in some cases, see loop emitter test).
- replaces an ad-hoc simplification in fusion_emitter.cc with
  a more general one

Also remove most of the change detector tests in reduction_test.

2400151139,pull_request,closed,,[xla:cpu] Replace memcpy with bit_cast in runtime TopK,"[xla:cpu] Replace memcpy with bit_cast in runtime TopK

This allows the lambda to be constexpr as bit_cast does basically the same work here, except it provides constexpr benefits. Also, the convert_to_int is static now which omits the need for capturing it in the partial_sort comparison.

Benchmark results ranged from about equal to about -5% depending on a scenario. Negative values denoted time saved/improvement.

AsyncValueRef<T> is a reference-counted wrapper around the pointer of type `T`, and has a semantics very similar to std::shared_ptr<T>, with extra async features on top of basic reference counting. Delete implicit constructor that converts values of type `T` into AsyncValueRef<T> wrappers to be more consistent with ""smart pointer"" semantics.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/13425

Here we add a new flag **xla_gpu_autotune_gemm_rtol** which controls the relative precision used by the BufferComparator (defaults to **0.1**).

Also I added one more ""paranoid"" level 5 for **xla_gpu_autotune_level** which forces the autotuner to discard solutions with accuracy problems. Long time I was under impression that the autotuner already does it, however this is not the case as outlined [here](https://github.com/ROCm/xla/blob/6301f04c50c7637a65b3e0c6f40be628aa00947f/xla/service/gpu/stream_executor_util.cc#L640). BufferComparator just prints out the error message but **keeps wrong solutions** as possible candidates which could lead to a great confusion. So, the autotune level 5 is supposed to discard solutions with accuracy problems.

Besides, I also did some small refactoring on BufferComparator to simplify the source code and added **verbose** flag in order to mute error messages if needed.

@xla-rotation: could you please have a look?
