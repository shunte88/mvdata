2397906511,pull_request,closed,,[XLA:GPU] Replace block_id_to_tile_offsets_indexing with N-d tile_offsets_indexing map.,"[XLA:GPU] Replace block_id_to_tile_offsets_indexing with N-d tile_offsets_indexing map.

Currently we compute an indexing map from 1-d block_id to N-d tile offset for each TiledHloInstruction. We use that indexing map to deduplicate identical tiles. To get the map we compute delinearization of block_id in SymbolicTileAnalysis.

Composition and simplification of `block_id_to_tile_offsets_indexing` is actually very computationally intensive, because it the expression has a lot of mods and floordivs from delinearization. This is not necessary for out purposes.

After this change, `TiledHloComputation` will have N-d to M-d map from N-d tile indexing into M-d tile offsets of the instruction. This way expressions in the map 
are much smaller and easier to simplify (see changes in symbolic_tile_analysis_test).

This change has an additional benefit that we don't enforce 1-d launch grid at the early stage.

2397672766,pull_request,open,,[TFLite] Use the same quantization info for broadcast_to input/output,"Broadcast_to has the operator property `restrict_same_input_output_scale=True`, however, this does not seem to be reflected by the mlir operator definitions in tfl_ops.td. This led to a case where the input quantization information differs to the output on creation of a quantized tflite flatbuffer file. This can cause type checking to fail at a later stage in mlir lowering (using tf-opt).

For example:
```
%3 = ""tfl.broadcast_to""(%0, %2) : (tensor<!quant.uniform<i8<-127:127>:f32, 0.1:-128>>, tensor<3xi64>) -> tensor<1x1x512x!quant.uniform<i8:f32, 0.1:-128>>
%6 = ""tfl.scatter_nd""(%4, %3, %5) : (tensor<1x1x2xi32>, tensor<1x1x512x!quant.uniform<i8:f32, 0.1:-128>>, tensor<3xi32>) -> tensor<1x224x512x!quant.uniform<i8:f32, 0.1:-128>>
```
results in the following error:
```
error: 'tfl.scatter_nd' op quantization parameters violate the same scale constraint: !quant.uniform<i8<-127:127>:f32, 0.1:-128> vs. !quant.uniform<i8:f32, 0.1:-128>
```

forcing the input and output quantization information to match using the `SameOperandsAndResultsScale` attribute fixes this. The following will now be generated after model conversion instead:
```
%3 = ""tfl.broadcast_to""(%0, %2) : (tensor<!quant.uniform<i8:f32, 0.1:-128>>, tensor<3xi64>) -> tensor<1x1x512x!quant.uniform<i8:f32, 0.1:-128>>
%6 = ""tfl.scatter_nd""(%4, %3, %5) : (tensor<1x1x2xi32>, tensor<1x1x512x!quant.uniform<i8:f32, 0.1:-128>>, tensor<3xi32>) -> tensor<1x224x512x!quant.uniform<i8:f32, 0.1:-128>>
```

In `B = custom-call(A), custom_call_target=""Sharding""`, we can set the sharding for `A` when all the three conditions are true.
1. Unspecified dims are empty. Otherwise, the sharding is open and can be further modified.
2. A has no sharding. We cannot overwrite the existing one.
3. A has only one user, which is B. Otherwise, the other users of A can also propagate shardings to A.

The first two conditions are checked before this cl. This cl add the third condition.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/14344

**Problem:** Currently in HLO dumping the syntactic sugar for async ops are turned on by default, while in nsys profile the op names are the actual op names, which is causing inefficiency when trying to correspond them.

**Solution:** Annotate syntactic sugar op name in nsys profile.

Unfortunately one of the tests is failing now, so disable it.
Two other cases relied on running the Fusion pass, and changes to the fusion

after fusion directly.
