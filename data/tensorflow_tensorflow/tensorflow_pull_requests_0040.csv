Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15417

This PR adds the availability to configure while loop unroll thresholds. Existing defaults are maintained. This PR also adds the option for the user to specify an HloPassPipeline that will be run immediately before unroll. This is very important and by design. Some proprietary passes need to be run immediately before the unroll as the last step. The pipeline is defaulted to nullptr.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15402

When debugging poor SPMD partitioning we sometimes see this warning. This warning implies there was a conflict in shardings so the tensor had to be fully rematerialized to reshard again. 

It is difficult to debug this without knowing which Hlo Instruction the conflict was on.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15518

I'm not 100% that I'm doing the right thing but I'll just say that after this, I got rid of some compilation errors on Windows and the linker seems to be happy so I think it may be ok. But let me describe my reasoning:

1. This [commit](https://github.com/openxla/xla/commit/b021ae8aef41a836d7cad4dbe761a88fe6b15b5a) added support for lazily loading symbols from the CUDA shared libraries.
2. As discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/openxla/xla/issues/6993), the current approach is not supported on Windows due to the use of GNU assembly (it results in compilation errors with MSVC).
3. After reading a little into this, I believe that Windows libraries built with MSVC already load the linked dynamic libraries lazily and so it appears that this trampoline mechanism is not needed on Windows.
4. For this reason, I made the trampoline bits conditional on not being on Windows hoping that the symbols will not directly be resolved to the CUDA dependencies that are coming in via the CUDA header files.

@metab0t is this what you were suggesting in the end of that discussion?

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15615

Without this patch, auto layouts for arguments and results turn into default layouts (in the
DetermineArgumentLayoutsFromCompileOptions function). This patch avoids calling
DetermineArgumentLayoutsFromCompileOptions from the MLIR compilation method
so that empty layouts on shapes are preserved.

With this patch we should be able to enable four more layout tests in JAX on GPUs.

HLO doesn't allow for implicit captured values in while regions, but MHLO does. Before this change there was a pre-processing step in `-xla-prepare-for-export` pass that would lift all free variables from mhlo::WhileOp and create new one where all free variables are additional operands.

This was problematic for two reasons:
1. We would rewrite the while op before converting to HLO, even though this can be done during the conversion as it is now done in this CL (I originally thought the pre-processing step was expensive but it's negligible).
2. We would discard unregistered attributes such as `mhlo.sharding` because we replace the `WhileOp` with a new `WhileOp`, we also can't naively copy all attributes to the new op becasue it now has more results than it used to (so the `mhlo.sharding` is no longer valid).

This change also removes the pre-processing step as it's no longer needed.

Changes to Shardy tests are expected.

With this change XLA:CPU instead of compiling one LLVM function for the whole HLO module compiles separate functions for different fusions and runs them via the interpreter-like runtime.

This can change numerics because of slightly different LLVM IR and missed cross-fusion optimizations. If this breaks your tests, they likely have to relax numerical error tolerance.

Another potential issue is performance regressions for while loops with large number of iterations and small computation, as instead of compiling, we run such loops in interpreter. We plan to fix it in the future.

To disable thunks runtime set env variable: XLA_FLAGS=--xla_cpu_use_thunk_runtime=false.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15252

This PR addresses the test timeout observed in oneDNN matmul test file.

In particular, this PR:

1. Replaces the test titled ConsecutiveBinaryAdd with a smaller test such that the test still hits the targeted failure case.
2. Shards the test file.
3. In addition, this PR also replaces all instances of the old proto definitions with the new ones.

Updates `github/codeql-action` from 3.25.11 to 3.25.15
<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md"">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>
<p>See the <a href=""https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases"">releases page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language packs.</p>
<p>Note that the only difference between <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> of the CodeQL Action is the node version they support, with <code>v3</code> running on node 20 while we continue to release <code>v2</code> to support running on node 16. For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>
<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>
<p>No user facing changes.</p>
<h2>3.25.15 - 26 Jul 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.1. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2385"">#2385</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.14 - 25 Jul 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Experimental: add a new <code>start-proxy</code> action which starts the same HTTP proxy as used by <a href=""https://github.com/github/dependabot-action""><code>github/dependabot-action</code></a>. Do not use this in production as it is part of an internal experiment and subject to change at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368"">#2368</a></li>
<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 9 July 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.26.0 and later and versions 2.26.0 and later. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2375"">#2375</a>
<ul>
<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.13.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>
<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.12.6 and 2.13.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.25.13</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.25.13</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=""https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes"">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2353"">#2353</a></li>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.18.0. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2364"">#2364</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.11 - 28 Jun 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid failing the workflow run if there is an error while uploading debug artifacts. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2349"">#2349</a></li>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.6. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2352"">#2352</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.10 - 13 Jun 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.5. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2327"">#2327</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.9 - 12 Jun 2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid failing database creation if the database folder already exists and contains some unexpected files. Requires CodeQL 2.18.0 or higher. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2330"">#2330</a></li>
<li>The init Action will attempt to clean up the database cluster directory before creating a new database and at the end of the job. This will help to avoid issues where the database cluster directory is left in an inconsistent state. <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2332"">#2332</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>3.25.8 - 04 Jun 2024</h2>

2441744729,pull_request,closed,,Propagate shardings to the root instruction of while condition.,"Propagate shardings to the root instruction of while condition.

### Sharding Propagation
Although the root instruction of while condition is in the shape `pred[]`. It can have the following meaningful shardings.
1. {replicated}
2. {manual}
3. subgroup sharding, e.g., {devices=[2,2]<=[4] last_tile_dims={manual, replicated}}

Thus, we need to propagate the sharding to the root such that the partitioner can correctly handle the while condition.

### SPMD Partitioner
The condition root must be replicated so that all partitions follow the same control flow. It can also have some tile dims to be manual. Thus, we need to replicate all data dims and keep the manual dims.

In cl/658203651, we reshard dot/conv operand into its expected sharding by calling `InferDotOperandSharding`. We need to ensure that `dims_mapping.conv_spatial_dims.empty()` before calling `InferDotOperandSharding`. If `dims_mapping.conv_spatial_dims.empty()`, we should directly proceed with the last resort (fully replicate the operand).
