Prior to this change, `HloRunnerPjRt` would fail during execution of
`FfiCustomCallTest.Tokens` (on CPU) because the `GenerateExecutionOptions`
function called `ComputationLayout::FlattenedResultLayouts`. This function
returns an error if any of the subshapes of the tuple are not arrays.

While it is possible to adapt the implementation of this particular function to
return only array shapes and skip over the non-array shapes, it would also
require changes in how the output buffers are allocated in the CPU compiler.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/19834

This patch adds async handling to dynamic slice fusion when the hero operation is a collective operation. Currently, only reduce-scatter is supported as a hero operation in dynamic slice thunk, so this patch also follows the same.

Added a test with compute, to ensure that communication and compute overlap in the thunks emitted.

- Support Op implementations based on the wrappers.
- Use `TensorPool` to manage the intermediate tensors, `TensorPool` can be abstract or change to allocator if need.
- All builders are functions which receive `TensorPool`, input output `TensorWrapper`, and the op-specific parameters.
- All builders are functions which return `std::vector<OpWrapper>`
- The interface of all builders is open to change based on the requirement.
- Make these builders independent to LiteRT/tflite, use c++ primitive types as parameters.
- Only dependent on QNN and `Wrappers`.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/21708

This ensures that the pinned host buffers used for transfers between host and device are pinned to the NUMA node closest to the device. It had a previous life as https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15216.

In a benchmark that triggers large, concurrent, copies from all devices to the host then achieved D2H throughput is around 33 GiB/s with NUMA pinning on a DGX H100 node (2xCPU, 8xH100). Without pinning, the achieved throughput is around 13.5 GiB/s from the same benchmark.

While it is already possible to achieve the correct NUMA pinning in process-per-GPU and process-per-NUMA-node configurations using `numactl` or similar, achieving correct pinning in process-per-node configuration requires logic inside XLA.

Remove ""if (VLOG_IS_ON(x))"" wrappers around VLOG, as they're useless.

This PR also fixes use-after-move of the ""graph"" local variable, which was previously not discovered, as it only happened when VLOG was enabled. (so not quite NFC)

This commit introduces the `Adapter` class, which provides an abstraction for dynamically loading and interfacing with the Google Tensor Compiler API. The adapter uses `dlopen` and `dlsym` to load the shared library at runtime and expose the `CompileFlatbuffer` function for compiling TFLite buffers.

1. Supports dynamic loading to decouple client code from the compiler implementation.
2. Provides a C++ interface to interact with the compiler API.
3. Utilizes C-style linkage for compatibility and to avoid name mangling.
4. Includes error handling for library loading and symbol resolution.

This change ensures modularity, allowing flexibility in loading different versions of the compiler without recompiling the client code.

2828896737,pull_request,closed,,Fix two bugs in NcclAllToAllStartThunk.,"Fix two bugs in NcclAllToAllStartThunk.

The first bug is that all-to-all ops with multiple replica groups did not work, because the thunk stored a map from local_id to some temporary memory used by the a2a implementation, where local_id was relative to the start of the replica_group. But this means devices of different groups would use the same temporary memory, overwriting each other's results. The fix is to change the map's key from local_id to StreamExecutor*.

The second bug is that the temporary memory mentioned above is registered as host memory but never deregistered. It is deregistered in NcclAllToAllStartThunk::Cleanup(), but Cleanup() is never called. If Cleanup() were to be called, it would fix the bug, but cause the memory to registered and deregistered every run of the executable, which is unacceptably slow. The fix is to deregister the memory in the thunk destructor instead, which is implicitly done by storing a se::MemoryAllocation instead of a int64_t* in the map.

Since the two fixes affect the exact same code, I'm putting them in a single change instead of two separate changes.

2828566679,pull_request,closed,,"[xla:python] Add a mechanism for ""batch partitioning"" of FFI calls.","[xla:python] Add a mechanism for ""batch partitioning"" of FFI calls.

This is the first in a series of changes to add a simple API for supporting a set of common sharding and partitioning patterns for FFI calls. The high level motivation is that custom calls (including FFI calls) are opaque to the SPMD partitioner, and the only ways to customize the partitioning behavior is to (a) explicitly register an `xla::CustomCallPartitoner` with XLA, or (b) use the `jax.experimental.custom_partitioning` APIs. Option (a) isn't generally practical for most use cases where the FFI handler lives in an external binary. Option (b) is flexible, and supports all common use cases, but it requires embedding Python callbacks in to the HLO, which can lead to issues including cache misses. Furthermore, `custom_partitioning` is overpowered for many use cases, where only (what I will call) ""batch partitioning"" is supported.

In this case, ""batch partitioning"" refers to the behavior of many FFI calls where they can be trivially partitioned on some number of (leading) dimensions, with the same call being executed independently on each shard of data. If the data are sharded on non-batch dimensions, partitioning will still re-shard the data to be replicated on the non-batch dimensions. This kind of partitioning logic applies to all the LAPACK/cuSOLVER/etc.-backed linear algebra functions in jaxlib, as well as some external users of `custom_partitioning`.

The approach I'm taking here is to add a new registration function to the XLA client, which let's a user label their FFI call as batch partitionable. Then, when lowering the custom call, the user passes the number of batch dimensions as a frontend attribute, which is then interpreted by the SPMD partitioner.

In parallel with this change, shardy has added support for sharding propagation across custom calls using a string representation that is similar in spirit to this approach, but somewhat more general. However, the shardy implementation still requires a Python callback for the partitioning step, so it doesn't (yet!) solve all of the relevant problems with the `custom_partitioning` approach. Ultimately, it should be possible to have the partitioner parse the shardy sharding rule representation, but I wanted to start with the minimal implementation.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/21708

This ensures that the pinned host buffers used for transfers between host and device are pinned to the NUMA node closest to the device. It had a previous life as https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/15216.

In a benchmark that triggers large, concurrent, copies from all devices to the host then achieved D2H throughput is around 33 GiB/s with NUMA pinning on a DGX H100 node (2xCPU, 8xH100). Without pinning, the achieved throughput is around 13.5 GiB/s from the same benchmark.

While it is already possible to achieve the correct NUMA pinning in process-per-GPU and process-per-NUMA-node configurations using `numactl` or similar, achieving correct pinning in process-per-node configuration requires logic inside XLA.

Previously, we had issues with the stream annotation being applied to non-Gemm operations, and having the compilation fail at IR emitter stage. Operations that normally should've been fused weren't getting fused inside the async computation. This PR is intended to fix this issue by including the call computations when searching for fusible computations.

 - shard them
 - autotune the shard
 - publish the shard
 - read the other shards
 - merge them into the local cache

This did not work when the ranks observed the cache(s) in different states - sharding requires the set of autotuned fusions to be exactly the same.

The new algorithm is:
 - collect unique fusions ignoring the caches
 - shard them
 - skip fusions present in the local caches of the rank
 - autotune the remainder
 - publish cached + new autotuned results comprising the shard
 - read the other shards

That seems to be a better approach then moving TransposeFold to simplification-2 in 961e5c25fbd4082a1ac4f2e0865ad28163d12f7d:

1. There is a report that previous change has resulted in perf degradation https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/22081

2. I have found another case when DotDecompose is competing with algsimp. Added a test for that.

Overall, having an pass that expands operation together with passes that are trying to do the simplification asks for such infinite loops.

---

For archeologists:  

passes DotDimensionSorter and DotDecomposer were added along with GpuAlgebraicSimplifier as it previously could have added multiple contracting dimensions to dot. But cudnn does not support dots with 2+ dimensions, forcing us to use a less efficient loop emitter. - That what ""// AlgebraicSimplifier may add contracting dimensions to a dot."" comment was about.

After a while simplifier started to use supports_non_canonical_dots to guard against this case. So it should be safe to remove dot decomposer and friends.

This did not work when the ranks observed the cache(s) in different states - sharding requires the set of autotuned fusions to be exactly the same.

The new algorithm is:
 - collect unique fusions ignoring the caches
 - shard them
 - skip fusions present in the local caches of the rank
 - autotune the remainder
 - publish cached + new autotuned results comprising the shard
 - read the other shards
 - merge them into the local cache overwriting on conflicts

[GPU] Fix sharded autotuning compatibility with result caching.

The algorithm before this change was:
 - collect unique non-cached fusions
 - shard them
 - autotune the shard
 - publish the shard
 - read the other shards
 - merge them into the local cache

This did not work when the ranks observed the cache(s) in different
states - sharding requires the set of autotuned fusions to be exactly
the same.

The new algorithm is:
 - collect unique fusions ignoring the caches
 - shard them
 - skip fusions present in the local caches of the rank
 - autotune the remainder
 - publish cached + new autotuned results comprising the shard
 - read the other shards
 - merge them into the local cache overwriting on conflicts

Merging this change closes #22164

* Metadata
* Raw arguments

The metadata is `HloUnoptimizedSnapshot` with `HloModuleProto` and a descriptor for each argument.
The descriptor specifies the size of the argument in bytes.
The raw arguments are serialized in the same format as `Literal::Serialize`.

I Updated the `HloUnoptimizedSnapshot` proto structure to store the metadata; introduced `CodedStreamInput(/Output)Iterator` -- interface for iterators over protobuf CodedStreams. This allows to use already existing `Literal::[De]Serialize` functions.

This paves the way for XLA:CPU fusion emitters.

Note that XLA:CPU is non-prod-compatible, whereas XLA:GPU is
not. The CPU fusion emitters will depend on the XLA, XLA:CPU
and XLA:GPU dialects, and given that the emitters' dependents
in XLA:CPU are non-prod-compatible, the three dialects have
to be as well.

XLA:CPU passes also have to be tagged. Crucially, thanks to
the parent CLs, XLA:GPU passes are not used anymore by any of
the above dialects nor by XLA:CPU passes, so XLA:GPU remains
essentially untouched; we just tag the XLA:GPU dialect.

Some common libraries in xla/codegen/emitters are also tagged.

depending on GPU ops is OK.

AllToAll with the flag --set_xla_gpu_use_memcpy_local_p2p=1 would previously crash or give incorrect results when there were multiple replica groups on GPUs. The issue is NcclAllToAllStartThunk had maps from the device ID to various buffers used for the all-to-all. The device ID was previously modded by the size of the current replica_group, which meant devices in different replica groups could share device IDs, causing them to use share buffers, causing incorrect results or crashes. The device ID is no longer modded by the size of the replica_group.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/21886

After this PR https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/73926 is merged, we can remove unnecessary low-level DoMatmul functions from GpuBlasLt interface (which otherwise looks scary and unnecessarily complicated).

Furthermore, we can also remove **ValidateInputs** function from the interface and derived classes since a high-level **ExecuteOnStream** function already handles data-types correctly. This also greatly simplifies the code.

Also, I have packed the input arguments of ExecuteOnStream calls to a struct **MemoryArgs** to simplify arguments passing in derived classes and improve code readability.

Finally, in the original GpuBlasLt PR: https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/5911, I made a sort of mistake by adding a reference to **blas_lt** to the MatmulPlan class [here](https://github.com/openxla/xla/blob/main/xla/stream_executor/rocm/hip_blas_lt.h#L135), thereby making MatmulPlans bound to a **particular BlasLt instance**. This resulted in some further bugfixes and, most importantly, complicated GpuBlasLt cache design in gpublas_lt_matmul_thunk.cc/.h. In this PR, I remove this reference again from MatmulPlan class and in the next NFC PR the cache mechanics can also be simplified. 

Unfortunately, this change also requires a tandem PR for Tensorflow: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/85835

2824043983,pull_request,open,,PR #21746: [NVIDIA GPU] Add collective-permute combiner,"PR #21746: [NVIDIA GPU] Add collective-permute combiner

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/21746

For collective-permutes with small message sizes, it is beneficial to combine them into a single collective because
1. it gets rid of some kernel launch overhead, and allows NCCL to do some message fusion;
2. fewer collectives make it easier for LHS to make better decision.

On top of the multi-operand collective-permute added in https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/18838, this PR adds a combiner for collective-permutes.

This change improves the stability and backward compatibility of Pallas Triton
calls, because unlike PTX, the Triton dialect has no stability guarantees
and does change in practice.

See #25196.

A few notes

* Pallas Triton no longer delegates compilation to PTX to XLA:GPU. Instead,
  compilation is done via a new PjRt extension, which uses its own compilation
  pipeline mirrored after the one in the Triton Python bindings.
* The implementation of the old custom call used by Pallas Triton is
  deprecated and will be removed after 6 months as per
  [compatibility guarantees] [*]
