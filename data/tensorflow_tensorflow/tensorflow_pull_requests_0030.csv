Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/17493

It turns out that in some cases, we get two calls to GetNcclCliqueKey that only differ by the order of the groups (for instance, one call with groups={{0,1},{2, 3}}, another call with groups={{2,3},{0,1}}. This leads to unnecessary creation of equivalent NCCL communicators.

This patch sorts the groups in NCCL clique key so that we create the same key for the same set of groups (up to permutation).

This change adds `DeviceList::AddressableDeviceList()`, which returns a

`DeviceList`. It returns itself if the original `DeviceList` contains only
addressable devices.

`BasicDeviceList` gets a tsan-friendly implementation of
`AddressableDeviceList()` that lazily computes it.

It also removes internal state sharing between `BasicDeviceList` objects, as
`BasicDeviceList` is no longer copyable since `DeviceList` is wrapped with
`tsl::RCReference<>`.

The communications of all-to-all rely on NCCL even when it is intra-node. By leveraging memcpy for intra-node communications, all-to-all can have better performance while reducing SM consumption (right now consumed by NCCL).

2546069120,pull_request,closed,,[XLA] Introduce unrolling as a way to eliminate loop aliasing copies,"[XLA] Introduce unrolling as a way to eliminate loop aliasing copies

Pipelined loops have inherent aliasing interference in them, due to loop inputs shift positions across iterations. This results in copy insertion adding copies for each pipelined input. In some cases extra copies on top of this are needed to properly sequence all the mandatory aliasing copies. Overall, this type of overhead makes pipelined loops a non-viable choice in HLO.

It is not necessary to insert copies to resolve interference in this case. The loop inputs, despite directly carried out as loop outputs, still have finite lifetimes across a certain amount of loop iterations. If the loop was unrolled just enough times to have the lifetimes of its inputs end before the outputs would be materialized, this would implicitly remove any sort of interference. The drawback of this approach is that it can in some cases drastically increase compile times due to linearly increasing graph size.

Add an option to CopyInsertion to perform this type of loop preprocessing before any copies would be inserted. Users can opt in if they want to trade compile time for execution time.

Since now we can exclude targets from building using tags, we won't need the `cuda_only_cc_library` rule anymore.

This also required me to remove some wrongly added dependencies, notably
I found several targets depending on `cublas_plugin`, even though those targets
were not CUDA specific and shouldn't directly depend on CUDA-specific targets.

I also found out that the `tsl_gpu_library` macro is not handling its `cuda_deps`
attribute correctly. It was adding those dependencies both for ROCm and for CUDA.
So this change is fixing that as well.

It is the case that was not covered when BF16_BF16_F32_X3 was introduced.

We enable F32 input in algorithm_util.cc. But the default behavior led to F32_F32_F32 triton that was slower than the cuBLAS with ~21ms. I.e. it was not faster despite lower precision and at the same time the fusion was forbidden due to ""Pure matmul"".

With the explicit truncation the F32 input to BF16 in the triton emitter we could reach the latency ~4ms which is way better than F32_F32_F32 (~21ms), and BF16_BF16_F32_X3 (~13ms), and BF16_BF16_F32_X6 (~18ms), but it is still slower that the clear dot for BF16 arguments (1.53ms).

Fix ActivationOffloadingTest.test_remat_scan_layout_change_offloadable in JAX.
The test in memories_test.py failed with an INVALID_ARGUMENT error:
- A tensor moved to host (from ""dynamic-update-slice.13"") was used by an 
  instruction (""transpose.32"") not acceptable during pure memory offload.

Root cause:
- LayoutNormalization inserts a transpose
- AlgebraicSimplifier replaces certain transposes with bitcast transposes
- These transposes/bitcasts are invalid in host memory offloading segments

Solution:
Move HostOffloadLegalize before LayoutNormalization to prevent this issue.

A couple of changes from the original change:
  1. Don't use HloInstruction::operand_index() - this only returns the
     *first* occurence of an instruction in the operand sequence, thus if
     the same instruction is used in place of multiple orepards, we'll miss the
     subsequent ones.
  2. Handle propagating throught root instructions better. We originally
     only fixed up entry computation roots but we need should the same for
     any while/conditional root, otherwise inserting tokens in these types
     of roots is non-trivial. Simplify things by explicitly disjoining these
     instructions from being roots during canonicalization.

```

To solve ""global qualification of class name is invalid"" issue we can add `namespace xla::ffi { ` block to the macros and remove `::xla::ffi::` prefix in struct decls inside `XLA_FFI_REGISTER_*` macros

To handle situations where `mhlo.multiply` and `mhlo.subtract` can run in any order, we need to make the test more flexible by using `CHECK-DAG` instead of `CHECK`.

mihaimaruseac on (2024-09-24 12:56:24 UTC): That looks weird, there should be no change in API.

mattbahr (Issue Creator) on (2024-09-24 14:45:30 UTC): Could it be the doc test failing? I'm also getting some failures when I run that in my environment, but not for any API entry points that I would expect have anything to do with range.

mihaimaruseac on (2024-09-24 14:56:20 UTC): It's an issue with strict dependencies (BUILD rules):

mattbahr (Issue Creator) on (2024-09-30 13:22:07 UTC): Hi @mihaimaruseac is there anything holding up this PR at this point? Or is it just waiting on resources to finish the checks and merge?

mihaimaruseac on (2024-09-30 14:57:49 UTC): Hi. It needs to be reviewed internally by someone other than me.

- It also adds that type to TF2XLA bridge so it can be converted properly.
- The diff seen in tf_generated_ops.td and tf_ops.td is shown because of moving the definition of TF_UniformDequantizeOp and TF_UniformQuantizeOp from the first file to the latter. That was done to respect [this ](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/b13548b8be8093bc6c742354cd2c56a16ac8f24d/tensorflow/compiler/mlir/tensorflow/ir/tf_generated_ops.td#L16-L24)comment.

2. Make op_id in the RequestMetadata be generated within client_session. In addition to making things easier for the upcoming CL, this change makes the entirety of the RequestMetadata and the ResponseMetadata be managed within client_session, instead of having that logic spread across.
3. Separate out convenience classes from the current code that will be reused by the upcoming CL: a `Queue` implementation in test_utils.h and a `XFlowHelper` in rpc_helper.cc.

IFRT will introduce its `Layout` interface that follows IFRT conventions (LLVM
RTTI and IFRT SerDes). PjRt-IFRT will have a wrapper around existing
`xla::PjRtLayout`. To incrementally migrate the code, we first spell out
`xla::ifrt::Layout` as `xla::PjRtLayout` before IFRT defines a separate
`xla::ifrt::Layout` class. They will eventually use `xla::ifrt::Layout` again,
but we will have a mix of `xla::PjRtLayout` and `xla::ifrt::Layout` in the IFRT
API during the transition.

This is needed for pipeline parallelism on GPU where the send/recv operations
are issued in one loop iteration and completed in the next. The same buffer
must be alive throughout the process and no copies can be inserted.

Avoid copies for these partially pipelined async send/recv ops. Insert the
required copies and controlflow constraints on the send/recv ops separately.
This is to ensure that the live times of the buffers do not overlap.

Send: For send, a copy is inserted on the operand, starting a new live range.
By enforcing this copy after the corresponding send/done, buffer live times are
disjoint.

Recv: For recv, a copy is inserted after recv-done, ending the live time of the
buffer. Bt enforcing the copy to be before the corresponding recv. buffer live
times are disjoint.

Within `build()`, some Keras layers where calling `super().build(input_shape)` while some were calling `self.built = True`. This would result in a different config when serializing whereby layers doing `self.built = True` would not have a `build_config`.

This change makes it consistent between all the layers as well as consistent with Keras 3.

Note that some layers need to call `Layer.build(self, input_shape)` directly to bypass some class' `build()` but still populate the information for the `build_config`.

This PR parametrizes float8 conversion tests to make sure all combinations are covered.
All 5 supported float8 types' tests now follow the same pattern in the test file.

Previously, the following tests were missing:
- Conversion from F8e4m3b11fn to PRED;
- Denormal and negative zero tests from F16 to F8e5m2;
- `ConvertF32F8e5m2Roundtrip` was missing (test conversion from F32 to F8e5m2);
- The complete set of exhaustive tests (vs other types) was only present for FNUZ types;
- ...probably more

Also merged the ""Exhaustive4"" and ""Exhaustive5"" suffixed tests that followed a similar pattern.
Removed unnecessary saving/restoring of the debug options.

Create NumPy 1.x and 2.x compatible versions of np.where and np.reshape

np.where: When only condition is provided, np.where(condition) is a shorthand for np.asarray(condition).nonzero(). NumPy 2.1.0rc0 disallows 0D input arrays in nonzero, so np.atleast_1d is used here to remain compatible with NumPy 1.x. See https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26268.

np.reshape: NumPy 2.1.0rc1 added shape and copy arguments to numpy.reshape. Both newshape and shape keywords are supported (use shape as newshape will be deprecated). Besides, shape cannot be None now. To remain behavior with NumPy 1.x, we now use asarray to create an ndarray. See https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26292.
