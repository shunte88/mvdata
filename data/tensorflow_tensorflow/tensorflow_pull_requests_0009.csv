2769861686,pull_request,closed,,Add a layout field to `xla::ifrt::ArraySpec`,"Add a layout field to `xla::ifrt::ArraySpec`

This is the most natural way to incrementally add layout support. `layout` can be nullptr, in which case it indicates a default layout, or non-existent layout info if the runtime and/or DType do not support layouts.

For now, the layout field uses `std::shared_ptr<const xla::PjRtLayout>` as the type, but this can be switched to an IFRT-native layout type once it's introduced. The serialization assumes that the layout is always `xla::PjRtXlaLayout`, which holds true because that is the only available `xla::PjRtLayout` implementation today. This isn't ideal, but it is the only feasible way due to the lack of type-erased deserialization for `xla::PjRtLayout`. We don't have to worry about the backward compatibility of the serialization format right now because IFRT Proxy does not support layouts yet.

2768410323,pull_request,closed,,Simplify the SPMD partitioner on concatenate operations.,"Simplify the SPMD partitioner on concatenate operations.

There is NO change if the concatenate result is replicated along the concatenate dimension. If this dimension is partitioned, this cl simplifies the partitioner.

**Before.**
Allocate the full output shape (i.e., make the concat dimension replicated), each partition updates its owned region, all-reduce across partitions and then slice its output region.

**After.**
1. Replicate the final sharding along the concatenate dimension to get `temp_sharding`.
2. Reshard the operands to `temp_sharding`.
3. Concatenate the operands to get result in `temp_sharding`.
4. Reshard the result from `temp_sharding` to the final sharding.

An advantage of this method is that we use the standard `Reshard` API to save the cache for concatenate. The partitioner remembers that concatenate already has a copy with replicated sharding along the concat dimension. It can avoid unnecessary reshards when handling the following pattern generated by `jax.numpy.roll`.

If the concatenate dimension is sharded, we
1. allocate the full size along the concatenate dimension
2. for each operand, each partition updates its owned region
3. all-reduce to get the result with full size along the concatenate dimension
4. reshard to the final sharding, i.e., shard the concatenate dimension

An alternative is to directly reshard each operand such that they are replicated along the concatenate dimension. However, this may introduce a lot of resharding compared to the method above.

An advantage of this method is that we use the standard `Reshard` API to save the cache for concatenate. The partitioner can remember that the all-reduce corresponds the concatenate result with replicated sharding along the concat dimension. It can avoid unnecessary reshards when handling the following pattern generated by `jax.numpy.roll`.

2768352102,pull_request,closed,,Change IFRT and PjRt layout API to return `std::shared_ptr<const xla::PjRtLayout>` instead of `std::unique_ptr<xla::PjRtLayout>`,"Change IFRT and PjRt layout API to return `std::shared_ptr<const xla::PjRtLayout>` instead of `std::unique_ptr<xla::PjRtLayout>`

The current API design that uses `std::unique_ptr<xla::PjRtLayout>` has several issues:

* The API requires `xla::PjRtLayout` to be copied in some scenarios, e.g., `xla::ifrt::Array` internally stores a layout and returns its copy every time `layout()` is called. This forces implementations to break the abstraction boundary because `xla::PjRtLayout` is an abstract class and `std::unique_ptr<xla::PjRtLayout>` is not copyable. The current implementation either stores `xla::Layout` and creates `xla::PjRtLayout` every time, or downcasts `xla::PjRtLayout` to `xla::PjRtXlaLayout` to perform the copy.
* `xla::Layout` is expensive to copy (`sizeof(xla::Layout)` is 248 bytes as of 2025-01-03) and copying `xla::PjRtXlaLayout` requires copying or moving `xla::Layout`.

To address these two problems, this CL changes PjRt and IFRT APIs that return `xla::PjRtLayout` to instead use `std::shared_ptr<const xla::PjRtLayout>`, so that PjRt layouts can be cheaply copied. Similar patterns have been used in other places such as `xla::ifrt::Sharding` and `xla::PjRtExecutable::GetHloModules()`.

Some implementations have been updated to take advantage of this change. For example, `PjRtCApiBuffer::layout()` no longer performs a layout copy and instead reuses an internally cached instance of `std::shared_ptr<const xla::PjRtLayout>`.
