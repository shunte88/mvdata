Note that this fix only applies to QAT models containing
`tf.FakeQuantWithMinMaxVars` ops.

Currently, some models do not have their Mean ops properly annotated with fake
quants on output tensors. To address this we simply copy the params from the
input to the output tensor to allow the op to be quantized by later passes.

Admittedly, this isn't ideal as the output tensor should have its own FQ with
parameters that are likely to be different than those specified on the input
tensor. This simply works around a TF QAT bug and actually more closely
replicates behavior that the now deleted TOCO converter exhibited on
applicable models.

2598506002,pull_request,closed,,Add cluster register barrier feature - synchronized connects.,"Add cluster register barrier feature - synchronized connects.

This has a few benefits:
* Simplify state changes during init to be all-or-nothing op: Nobody will send heartbeat until everybody in the cluster has acked. That's less error flows to reason about during init.

* This helps with consistent in-sync restarts. There's no weird staggering / cascading restart flows regardless of what the scheduler does.

Concretely:
1. Task invokes connect.
2. Block until all tasks connect. In the meantime, tasks may restart multiple times without bringing down the service because initialization has not completed and there's nothing stateful that is corrupted.
3.  All tasks connect together.
4. Start sending heartbeats

---

Previously, we start sending heartbeats immediately after (1), which means that tasks restarting before (2) will result in service crashes, causing additional unnecessary restarts + scheduling overhead.

2596283549,pull_request,closed,,Fix crash in some cases when fusions had int4 inputs/outputs.,"Fix crash in some cases when fusions had int4 inputs/outputs.

Before, if a fusion had an int8 input and int4 output, or vice versa, and the int4 tensor was not a ROOT or parameter of the entry computation, a crash could occur. The reason is the FusionCanShareBufferHint would incorrectly use ByteSizeOfPrimitiveType instead of BitWidth to check if two buffers were the same size.

I found this through an autogenerated HLO with XLA smith, to test an unrelated change that adds int4 support to most ops. Unfortunately the HLO, which is added as a test case, is pretty weird. It has a dot with no contracting or non-contracting dimensions, just consisting of batch dimensions. The issue also only occurred with algebraic simplifier disabled. 

I couldn't find any simpler HLO that had a fusion with an int8 input and int4 output such that the int4 tensor was not a ROOT instruction. There must always be a convert back from int4 to int8 (as the int4 tensor cannot be a ROOT instruction), and any HLO I created would always have the fusion include the convert back to int8.

There seems to be no dedicated libdevice call for Exp with F16 or BF16 type.
Currently we upcast to F32 and use __nv_expf. However it seems likely that
__nv_fast_expf is good enough for F16 and BF16 type, so use it as it is
considerably faster.

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/17886

This PR is the 1st step (out of 2) to improve the performance of deterministic scatter. Originally, the scatter op will be expanded to be deterministic in `xla/service/ScatterExpander.cc`. However, since it took a while-loop-based approach, the performance is extremely poor. We designed and implemented a prefix-scan-based approach to rewrite the scatter operation to be an efficient deterministic scatter. This PR rewrites the scatter operation with scalar indices and updates, and leave the other scatter operations to be handled by original ScatterExpander. The 2nd PR to come will handle non-scalar indices and updates.

The second PR is at https://github.com/openxla/xla/pull/18326

Optimize deterministic scalar scatter

Performance Takeaways:
- Our optimized implementation shows significant speedup, especially with larger index sizes, achieving up to over 9,300x speedup in certain input and index sizes.
- Our implementation has a slight slowdown compared to the non-deterministic scatter. For most cases, we have a slowdown around 1x - 4x. In the worst case with a rare index size setup, we have a slowdown factor of 9.15.

Why? Tensorflow's strict pinning of this dependency is problematic for packages like JAX, which would like to update to newer ml_dtypes versions, but cannot because it would prevent JAX and tensorflow from being used in the same environment. No breaking changes were introduced in v0.5.0, and no breaking changes are anticipated in future minor version updates.
