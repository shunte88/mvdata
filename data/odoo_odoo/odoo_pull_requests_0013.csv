2766169994,pull_request,closed,,[FW][FIX] project_todo: set by default project to False in todo,"Before this commit, when the user sets a project as a default value for his tasks, that default value will also be applied inside To-Do app because a to-do is in fact a private task (that is, a task without any project set).

This commit adds a default value inside the context of the main action used in To-Do to make sure the default value for `project_id` field in To-Do is false and nothing else.

Steps to reproduce
==================

1. Install Project app
2. Go to Project app
3. Select/create a project
4. Select/create and edit a task inside
5. Enable the debug mode
6. Click on debug menu and select `Set Default Values`
7. Apply `project = <your project selected/created>` and save
8. Go to To-Do app
9. Create a to-do

Expected Behavior
-----------------

A to-do should be created without any issue in the kanban view.

Current Behavior
----------------

A form view will be displayed inside a modal to create the to-do but the form view is in fact the one used in Project app and the project set is the one set as default value instead of having no project since the user is creating a to-do and not a task inside that project.

- Install hr_timesheet (with demo data)
- Navigate to portal > timesheet
- Group by project

Issue:
When only the hr_timesheet module is installed and timesheets are grouped in the
portal view, the column alignment is broken due to an incorrect colspan.

Cause:
When groupby is applied, the colspan is manually set to 4, causing misalignment
between the header and row columns.

Fix:
This commit sets the last column's colspan to 2 when grouping is applied to fix the
alignment issue.

2766090282,pull_request,closed,,[FIX] hr_expense: force analytic distribution title display nowrap,"**Steps to reproduce:**
- Configure `Analytic Accounting` via `Accounting` module's settings;
- Go to `Analytic Plans` through `Accounting / Configuration / Analytic Accounting`:
    - Select any record and change its name for a really long one;

![Capture d’écran 2025-01-02 à 15 01 13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c77a4588-37b1-4217-a65f-3e3f8ea5f857)

- Go to `Expenses` app:
    - Select any expense in the list;
    - Open the `Analytic Distribution` widget.

___
**Issue:**
Long `Analytic Plans` names are wrapped and may lead to unreadable texts.

![Capture d’écran 2025-01-02 à 15 01 56](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e007cc0-822e-4a40-a23f-deced631668e)

___
**Expected:**
A smooth UI should display `Analytic Plans` as when accessed through an invoice line from `Accounting` app.

___
**Cause:**
The `Analytic Distribution` widget style of the invoice view inherits from the list renderer, forcing a `nowrap` style while the expense view of the same widget does not.

___
**Fix:**
Force a `nowrap` style for that specific widget.

2766085644,pull_request,closed,,[FW][FIX] web: ARIA attributes of field widgets not ported correctly to OWL,"When field widgets were ported to OWL in 48ef812a, a few ARIA attributes
were not adapted correctly. For instance, in the statusbar widget, the
title was ported as an `aria-label` attribute (""Current state"" and ""Not
active state""), which overrides the actual status name.

This commit fixes the above issue by removing the incorrect `aria-label`
attributes and fixing logic for other ones like `aria-checked`.

2766052216,pull_request,closed,,[FW][FIX] project_todo: set by default project to False in todo,"Before this commit, when the user sets a project as a default value for his tasks, that default value will also be applied inside To-Do app because a to-do is in fact a private task (that is, a task without any project set).

This commit adds a default value inside the context of the main action used in To-Do to make sure the default value for `project_id` field in To-Do is false and nothing else.

Steps to reproduce
==================

1. Install Project app
2. Go to Project app
3. Select/create a project
4. Select/create and edit a task inside
5. Enable the debug mode
6. Click on debug menu and select `Set Default Values`
7. Apply `project = <your project selected/created>` and save
8. Go to To-Do app
9. Create a to-do

Expected Behavior
-----------------

A to-do should be created without any issue in the kanban view.

Current Behavior
----------------

A form view will be displayed inside a modal to create the to-do but the form view is in fact the one used in Project app and the project set is the one set as default value instead of having no project since the user is creating a to-do and not a task inside that project.

Improvements includes :

1. If `New Blog Post` is selected from a specific blog, the pop-up
should default to that blog. For example, selecting it from `Travel`
should default to `Travel` This is made possible by passing the correct
context while calling action for pop-up.

2. Adds functionality to display details like publish date and author
when the `Title Inside Cover` layout is selected. Also adjusted 
performance test for the same as it makes extra queries while
accessing `blog_post` record set.

3. Replaces the static `Follow Us` links in the header with a dynamic
social media snippet, allowing users or blog owners to edit them. This
is also updated for blog post sidebar `Follow Us`.

2766019397,pull_request,open,,[FIX] account: prevent an error when create an invoice,"Currently, An error occurs when attempting to create an invoice, and the user entered an invalid date in the `Fiscal Periods` of the accounting settings.

Step to produce:

- Install the `accountant` module (without demo data).
- Go to Settings / Technical / Sequences & Identifiers / Sequences, And delete all records.
- Go to Accounting settings, Set the month to February and the day to 29 in the `Fiscal Periods` section,
- Go to Invoicing / Customers / Invoices, Try to create a new invoice.

`ValueError: day is out of range for month`

The issue occurs because the system attempts to get a 29th February at [1], But 29th February is not available in all years(e.g '2025').

Link [1]: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/0f507a8982a29bf1c35aaf9f8f97fc3d5381226c/addons/account/models/account_move.py#L3487

To resolve this, raise a validation error if the user enters an invalid date in the `Fiscal Year` of the accounting settings.

- Install hr_timesheet (with demo data)
- Navigate to portal > timesheet
- Group by project

Issue:
When only the hr_timesheet module is installed and timesheets are grouped in the
portal view, the column alignment is broken due to an incorrect colspan.

Cause:
When groupby is applied, the colspan is manually set to 4, causing misalignment
between the header and row columns.

Fix:
This commit sets the last column's colspan to 2 when grouping is applied to fix the
alignment issue.

The security threat comes from the fact that I override the ""on click"" event on a tag with an href attribute. The purpose is to first ask the server for some checks and then actually changing the window.location.href to the button.href.

As far as I know, clicking on a tag with an href attribute just changes the window.location.href to the button.href by defaults. But I'm not a JS expert nor a security expert and I don't know if there are url checks before the browser changes location in the default behavior.

To me, not sanitizing the url is safe in this context, but to be safe I made a commit that uses `encodeURI` and `encodeURIComponent` to safely reconstruct the url.

I let the security team be the judge to decide if this commit is needed, or not.

were not adapted correctly. For instance, in the statusbar widget, the
title was ported as an `aria-label` attribute (""Current state"" and ""Not

This commit fixes the above issue by removing the incorrect `aria-label`
attributes and fixing logic for other ones like `aria-checked`.

This commit adds a default value inside the context of the main action used in To-Do to make sure the default value for `project_id` field in To-Do is false and nothing else.

Steps to reproduce
==================

1. Install Project app
2. Go to Project app
3. Select/create a project
4. Select/create and edit a task inside
5. Enable the debug mode
6. Click on debug menu and select `Set Default Values`
7. Apply `project = <your project selected/created>` and save
8. Go to To-Do app
9. Create a to-do

Expected Behavior
-----------------

A to-do should be created without any issue in the kanban view.

Current Behavior
----------------

A form view will be displayed inside a modal to create the to-do but the form view is in fact the one used in Project app and the project set is the one set as default value instead of having no project since the user is creating a to-do and not a task inside that project.

2765910652,pull_request,closed,,[FW][FIX] hr_timesheet: adjust colspan when timesheets are groupby,"Steps to reproduce:
- Install hr_timesheet (with demo data)
- Navigate to portal > timesheet
- Group by project

Issue:
When only the hr_timesheet module is installed and timesheets are grouped in the
portal view, the column alignment is broken due to an incorrect colspan.

Cause:
When groupby is applied, the colspan is manually set to 4, causing misalignment
between the header and row columns.

Fix:
This commit sets the last column's colspan to 2 when grouping is applied to fix the
alignment issue.

2765862502,pull_request,closed,,"[FW][FIX] web_editor, website: prevent tab duplication","Steps To Reproduce:
-> Go to Edit mode.
-> Drag & Drop Tabs Snippet.
-> Click in middle of tab's text and press ""Enter"".
-> Tab is split and and new Tab is created.

Issue Reason:
As tab's element fails `isUnbreakable()` check for `Keydown`(Enter) event
which makes it possible to split the element. And issue is not specific
to Tab snippet but in other snippets where `anchor tag` and elements with
`btn` class or role attribute is `button`.

Solution:
By modifying checks in `isUnbreakable()` for handling elements with `anchor
tags` and elements with `btn` class or role attribute is `button`.

This PR solves the issue of tab duplication in Tab Snippet and few snippets in which there is already button and the said behavior is observed are : `Cover` , `Text - Image` , `Image - Text `, `Carousel `, `Donate
Now ( Button )` where anchor tag and elements with 'btn' class or role attribute is 'button', in `Masonry` and `Carousel` snippet which adds button
through `Add Element` option and also when we add a button using `/button` command in any snippets.

This issue was introduced during the conversion from jQuery to vanilla JavaScript.

Steps to reproduce:

- Enter the Website in edit mode.
- Navigate to Site > Menu Editor.
- Add several menu items until the menu exceeds its maximum width.
- Ensure that one of the items in the extra menu redirects to ""Contact Us"".
- Click on the ""Contact Us"" menu item.
- Open the dropdown menu (via the ""+"" icon) and observe that the ""Contact Us"" entry is not highlighted.

This commit resolves the problem.

Consequently, whenever the GSTIN number or API's credentials are updated, all associated tokens and
their validity are reset. New tokens must then be generated to ensure continued functionality.

As part of this **PR** following will be affected:
1) edi_token used for E-Invoicing.
2) auth_validity of E-Waybill authentication.

Additionally, a warning is added on GSTIN change, notifying users that re-establishing the connection for the APIs is required after updating the GSTIN.

One order line has a positive price for the product, while the other has a negative price for the promotion or loyalty product.
This fix removes the order line with the negative price from the cart, ensuring that only the correct order line remains.

2765750573,pull_request,closed,,"[FW][FIX] web_editor, website: prevent tab duplication","Steps To Reproduce:
-> Go to Edit mode.
-> Drag & Drop Tabs Snippet.
-> Click in middle of tab's text and press ""Enter"".
-> Tab is split and and new Tab is created.

Issue Reason:
As tab's element fails `isUnbreakable()` check for `Keydown`(Enter) event
which makes it possible to split the element. And issue is not specific
to Tab snippet but in other snippets where `anchor tag` and elements with
`btn` class or role attribute is `button`.

Solution:
By modifying checks in `isUnbreakable()` for handling elements with `anchor
tags` and elements with `btn` class or role attribute is `button`.

This PR solves the issue of tab duplication in Tab Snippet and few snippets in which there is already button and the said behavior is observed are : `Cover` , `Text - Image` , `Image - Text `, `Carousel `, `Donate
Now ( Button )` where anchor tag and elements with 'btn' class or role attribute is 'button', in `Masonry` and `Carousel` snippet which adds button
through `Add Element` option and also when we add a button using `/button` command in any snippets.

When a change is detected on the res.currency model, the webclient reloads currencies. Before this commit, it was done by reloading the whole session_info, which contains a bunch of other stuff, and thus doesn't really make sense.

This commit instead directly calls the brand new `get_all_currencies` method from the res.currency model. With the introduction of this method, we deprecate the `get_currencies` method from ir.http.py. It makes more sense on the res.currency model than on the ir.http model.

The test fails on odoo.sh with custom modules that only depend on sale and not sale_management.

The test succeeds in the condition mentionned above.

2764679309,pull_request,closed,,[FW][FIX] web_editor: remove listeners on destroy,"**Problem**:
When destroying a snippet, listeners are not cleared. As a result, when focusing on a new instance of `ReplaceMedia`, the previous listeners remain active with stale context (old `$target`), which no longer has a parent since it was removed during the `img` change.

**Solution**:
Clear listeners during the `destroy` process.

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Open the website.
2. Add items.
3. Change an image.
4. Unlink that image.

I have added a check on the `onchange` function to allow it to work only on accessible records/models. Except for res.users where SELF_WRITEABLE_FIELDS overwrites the way it works.
Also there is a record rule that is overwritten which I removed since it does not show up anymore.

`USER_PRIVATE_FIELDS` is used for only one field and we have `groups=NO_ACCESS` if we want to prevent access to a field. The user should be able to read that field for themselves and have an anonymized value for others. This can be simply implemented by a compute field depending on the current uid.

beledouxdenis on (2025-01-07 12:59:33 UTC): I agree a change is welcome here and that list `USER_PRIVATE_FIELDS` can be removed.

Is it useful that a user can see his access token ? I don't see a use case for this. I would not even do that compute field.

I would also remove the field from the interface. Maybe replace by a button ""Delete the access token"" or something visibile when it's defined. There is little use for the administrator to be able to read the access token, but it's important there is a way to remove the access token, in case he wants to revoke the access for a leaked token.

kmagusiak (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-07 14:14:44 UTC): @beledouxdenis I have added a button to remove the token.
Do you want me to remove the shown value? I will still need a computed field so that the admin knows whether a value is set. `has_oauth_user_access_token` (bool)?

beledouxdenis on (2025-01-07 14:49:26 UTC): Except if you see / someone sees a use case / an added value that a user should be able to see his access token. or if an admin should be able to read fully the access token, yes I would completely remove `_compute_oauth_user_access_token` and remove the field from the view.

2764477259,pull_request,closed,,[FW][FIX] sale_project: show new created task through the sale order,"Issue:
  In the task action view of the sale order, the task ID is passed in the action domain, which results in showing only
  old tasks. Newly created tasks are not visible because their   IDs are not included in the domain.

Solution:
  Instead of passing task ids, we now check for project_id, sale_order_id, or sale_line_id  to ensure the new tasks are properly displayed.

Steps to Reproduce:
   - Install the sale_project module.
   - Create a Sale Order (SO).
   - Add a product configured to create a project with tasks.
   - Click on the ""Tasks"" smart button from the SO.
   - Go to the Kanban view.
   - Create a new task and give a name.
   - Reload the page.
   - Check if the task is visible (the issue was that new tasks were not visible).

2764364818,pull_request,closed,,[FW][FIX] mrp: fix traceback on onchange of product uom qty in stock move,"Currently, a traceback is occurring when the user removes the `uom` and 
tries to change the `product_uom_qty` in the stock move. While creating the Manufacturing Order.

To reproduce this issue:

1) Install MRP and enable UOM from the configuration 
2) Create a new mrp order and add a product in components
3) Remove the UOM and change the `To Consume` value

Error:- 
```
AssertionError: precision_rounding must be positive, got 0.0
```

This traceback occurs because when the user changes the `product_uom_qty`, 
an onchange method `_onchange_product_uom_qty` will triggered.

In that method, `float_round` is used with precision_rounding getting from `product_uom.rounding`. 
It leads to the above traceback as `product_uom` has an empty recordset.

element is text, in other cases we still need to update the attributes
to avoid upgrade issues.

For example, this term
https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blame/03434f42d2b1d96d2cf8315154f16f9fa01c1ae3/addons/account/i18n/fr.po#L1129

even if we add the right translation
```
msgid """"
""<span invisible=\""name or name_placeholder or quick_edit_mode\"">Draft</span>""
msgstr """"
""<span invisible=\""name or name_placeholder or quick_edit_mode\"">Brouillon</span>""

The reason is that the check
```py
if closest_term in translation_dictionary:
    continue
```
would skip the update. Here we propose to restrict the skip only to text
elements.

HydrionBurst on (2025-01-10 12:58:26 UTC): before upgrade there was a term `""Draft""` translated to `""Brouillon""`

when write with new value during upgrade
the old term `""Draft""` is handled for typofixing

In the new value
the new term `""<span invisible=\""name or name_placeholder or quick_edit_mode\"">Draft</span>""` has the same text as the old term

So, the old translation `""Brouillon""` will be used as the fr_FR value for the new term `""<span invisible=\""name or name_placeholder or quick_edit_mode\"">Draft</span>""`
and when importing the po files, since the `overwrite=False`, the new term `""<span invisible=\""name or name_placeholder or quick_edit_mode\"">Draft</span>""` will be treated as translated value and won't use the translation in the po files

As a result
after upgrade the fr_FR translation for the new term `""<span invisible=\""name or name_placeholder or quick_edit_mode\"">Draft</span>""` will be ""Brouillon""

I propose something like PR: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/193229 as a fix which will revert an old fix by you
The idea is totally disabling the typofixing logic when upgrade. When the en_US value is changed, we always clear the translations and rely on the latest po files to update corresponding translations

In GCC countries, the POS receipt displays duplicate ""Served by"" text due to inconsistent handling of the cashier field in the getReceiptHeaderData method.

Current behavior before PR:
1. The ""Served by"" text is duplicated on POS receipts for GCC countries.
2. The issue arises from both the base implementation and the l10n_gcc_pos module adding the ""Served by"" prefix.

Desired behavior after PR is merged:
1. The POS receipt correctly displays the cashier's name without duplication.
2. For GCC countries, the ""Served by"" prefix is removed, and only the cashier's name is displayed.
3. Non-GCC countries remain unaffected.

2764308896,pull_request,closed,,[FIX] l10n_ch: non 256 size barcode has cross centered,"Scenario:

- install l10n_ch
- go to /report/barcode/?barcode_type=QR&value=&width=150&height=150&mask=ch_cross

=> the ch_cross mask (swiss cross that should be in the center) is not
in the center

Issue:

Reportlab QrCodeWidget has a fixed size to 32mm (with mm that is 72(ppi)
/ 25.4(1mm to inch) so ~2.83 pixels) and to get the widget to the full
size, a zoom is applied on the Drawing content (so on the QrCodeWidget).

Here are the zoom that are applied for several Drawing size:

- for 100 pixels: 100 / (32 * mm) => 1.012…
- for 256 pixels: 256 / (32 * mm) => 2.822…
- for 400 pixels: 400 / (32 * mm) => 4.409…

But in the code, the zoom is just hardcoded to mm (~2.83) which
corresponds to a barcode size of mm * 32 * mm => 257.127 pixels which is
kind of good enough for 256 pixels, but wrong for most other size.

In base code we only use 256 x 256 pixels so this is not much of an
issue unless someone want to use it for something else.

Fix:

With this commit, we apply the Drawing zoom (on which we have the
QrCodeWidget) to the ch_cross image.

Note:

Without the fix, the added test only fail on the third assertion for
each loop iteration, the farer we are from 257x257 pixels the bigger
the error is, for example for 256x256:

Result:   (38.45140, 38.45140, 52.25725984251969, 52.25725984251969)

PR NOTE: this could be merged in an higher version, and we could also just not fix this since as far as I can tell, we only need to support 256x256 and with and without the fix there is just one pixel of difference in this case.

2764297088,pull_request,open,,[IMP] l10n_in_edi_ewaybill: stop e-waybill for credit notes,"Following the fixes - https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/ce92dedea0fd3cdc73da6366c20b8052bb04f7e9 & https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/4dc901e77dc7e2873a94ea3a541450fc9fb2eb5e

Investing more into the issues, we found out that E-waybill portal, doesn't allow generation of E-waybill as Inwards (Tax Invoice) type for Sales Return, Only Challan Type is accepted it means that the Sales Return, E-waybill should be generated by the E-waybill on Stock/Inventory. Not through the Invoice/Account App.

This commit intends to do a soft block for generation of E-waybill through Sales
