2839664451,pull_request,open,,Improve SFTP hook's directory transfer to use a single connection for multiple files,"This PR improves SFTP hook's `store_directory` and `retrieve_directory` functions to use a single connection when transferring a directory with multiple files.

Previously, these functions relied on `store_file` and `retrieve_file` functions. And with this [PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44247), the `store_file` and `retrieve_file` functions were modified to open and close sftp connection each time.
This leads to the `store_directory` and `retrieve_directory` functions to open and close too many connections repeatedly when there are many files in a directory, which causes significant overhead.

To address this, I modified them to open a connection, transfer all files in a directory, and then close the connection afterward.

I also did a performance test in my local environment by transferring a directory containing 1,000 small files. This reduced the transfer time by approximately 8-9 seconds. The results are shown below.

|        | AS-IS     | TO-BE     |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| store  | 47.18 sec | 39.35 sec |
| retrieve | 63.50 sec | 54.73 sec |

This PR adds AWS Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) integration to the Amazon Provider Package. The integration includes:

1. `MwaaTriggerDagRunOperator`: Allows triggering DAGs in an MWAA environment
2. `MwaaHook`: A generic hook to interact with MWAA environments via REST API

To run the `example_mwaa` system test, there needs to be an existing environment already created. In the future, when we add a `CreateEnvironmentOperator`, there will be a separate system test just for that operator. This approach was chosen due to the significant time required for MWAA environment creation.

botocore.errorfactory.ValidationException: An error occurred (ValidationException) when calling the CreateVirtualCluster operation: Cluster env40beb96b-cluster is not reachable as its connection is currently being updated
```

The only thing we can do is wait longer ...

This PR does three things:
1. Moves top level import from Google's OpenLineage utils into operator's execute method, to avoid issues with ImportError, should they happen in the future.
2. Adds try/except for OpenLineage code in DataProc operators, so that any error related to OpenLineage does not affect execution of DataProc.
3. Moves `BigQueryJobRunFacet` to a separate file and add try/except on class definition, in case OpenLineage is not available (similar logic as in common.compat provider). I've also moved the import of this facet into specific method in _OpenLineageMixin, so it's no longer top level import.

I've tested it manually on the environment without OpenLineage and the error described in the issue is gone after applying  changes included in this PR.

2838190818,pull_request,open,,AIP-83 refactor backfill reprocess behaviour,"closes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/46278
[AIP-83: Restore Uniqueness Constraint on Logical Date, Make It Nullable](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/46295) impacted backfill reprocessing behavior. Now, attempting to reprocess a run with the same logical date results in a unique constraint error.

This PR fixes that behavior by clearing the existing run before reprocessing, restoring the legacy behavior instead of creating a new run.

Now we are not getting Unique constraint if reprocess behaviour is  `completed`  or `failed`

related: #45623 (AIP-66 cleanup)

Before migrating the rest of entities in DB that rely on an absolute path of the DAG to use relative one + bundle name, this PR clearly separates the cases where DAG metadata has absolute path determined from the ones, where it is not needed. Effectively, it splits `DagFileInfo` into 2 entities:
  - `DagEntrypoint` - where DAG(s) file is referenced without a tie to any version (and path where it is actually present as a file)
  - `ParseFileInfo` - where DAG(s) file is parsed within a fixed parse context - here we guarantee that the file has some absolute path attached to it and can be read.

This separation of types delegates the pain of figuring out of ""do I have an absolute path set here?"" to static type checks and revealed a couple of bugs in tests.
With this implemented, the migration of DAG code and import errors becomes straight forward and removes the need to pass multiple additional parameters across multiple methods in `dag_processing/collection.py` of model. Otherwise we would have to drag bundle's name, path and version as arguments across multiple functions (or do an even more disruptive refactoring, which wouldn't align with feature-freeze goals at all).

One of the responsibility of the auth manager is to provide the url of the login page. This URL differs whether we are in the context of AF2 or AF3. To address both use cases, I introduce an ugly flag to specify whether the auth manager is run in AF2 or AF3. This is temporary and will be removed when the AF2 Flask application is removed.

The thing is that with botocore tests we are upgrading to latest (i.e. newest) possible botocore - basically by removing aiobotocore that holds it back.

potiuk on (2025-02-06 17:10:25 UTC): pushed likely fix

kunaljubce (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-06 17:14:45 UTC): Thanks @potiuk. For my understanding, can you please explain a little about the botocore issue?

potiuk on (2025-02-06 18:21:09 UTC): Yeah. The thing is that with botocore tests we are upgrading to latest (i.e. newest) possible botocore - basically by removing aiobotocore that holds it back. The `aiobotocore` is non-aws, 3rd-party async botocore extension and the problem with it is that it lags behind the main botocore - which is released almost daily

See: https://pypi.org/project/botocore/#history
vs. https://pypi.org/project/aiobotocore/#history

botocore - released today, aiobotocore released 22 Jan and it has `Requires-Dist: botocore<1.36.4,>=1.36.0` -> 1.36.0 of botocore was released on 15th of Jan.

So those tests are removing aiobotocore and try to run all the tests with latest botocore. And yandex also uses a aiobotocore I think.

I see my fix did not work, so I have to fix it differently

potiuk on (2025-02-06 18:56:59 UTC): Ok. I pushed simplified version. I think in this case we do not have to run `pip check` - because this is what caused the failures. When we simply upgrade botocore to latest version it will cause conflicting dependencies with other package(s) - - but this should be no big issue , as long as all the tests pass.

potiuk on (2025-02-06 18:57:14 UTC): :crossed_fingers:

potiuk on (2025-02-06 19:55:12 UTC): AAAAAH... Merged tooo fast... good eye Jens.

potiuk on (2025-02-06 20:00:27 UTC): Ah no --... yandex docs were copied previously (accidentally) as part of another provider (TERADATA) :) . All good :)

jscheffl on (2025-02-06 20:56:30 UTC): Did not know but good you confirmed.... and no Aaaah :-D

This pull request resolves a Pydantic validation error in the `DmsDescribeReplicationConfigsOperator` tests caused by a missing `logical_date` field in the DagRun instance. The test was updated to set `logical_date` using `execution_date`, ensuring successful validation and correct construction of the template context.

Previously it was throwing following error:
```
providers/tests/amazon/aws/operators/test_dms.py:503: in test_template_fields_native
    context = ti.get_template_context(session)
airflow/models/taskinstance.py:3242: in get_template_context

2835109708,pull_request,closed,,OTEL metric export: Switch ObservableGauge to sync Gauge metric export,"# Overview
Hi Airflow community,

I´m currently trying to get Airflow metrics exported via OTEL -> Prometheus into Grafana Dashboards. I wanted to use the label advantage of OTEL to create nice Dashboards. 

During the implementation I found an issue and will use metric airflow_dag_processing_last_duration to explain the details:

This metric is exported in 2 different ways in the Airflow code, to support statsd way and otel way with labels.
Stats.timing(f""dag_processing.last_duration.{file_name}"", stat.last_duration)
Stats.timing(""dag_processing.last_duration"", stat.last_duration, tags={""file_name"": file_name})

The following prometheus example contains metric export for 2 dags (dag1, dag2). But the metric with the label (Otel) does only export the metric for 1 dag. Metric export with file_name in the metric name is exported for 2 dags.

| # HELP airflow_dag_processing_last_duration
| # TYPE airflow_dag_processing_last_duration gauge
| airflow_dag_processing_last_duration{file_name=""dag1"",job=""Airflow""} 0.293856

| # HELP airflow_dag_processing_last_duration_dag1
| # TYPE airflow_dag_processing_last_duration_dag1  gauge
| airflow_dag_processing_last_duration_dag1 {job=""Airflow""} 0.293856
| # HELP airflow_dag_processing_last_duration_blabla2
| # TYPE airflow_dag_processing_last_duration_blabla2 gauge
| airflow_dag_processing_last_duration_dag2{job=""Airflow""} 0.343803

would expect that the metric is also exported like this:
| airflow_dag_processing_last_duration{file_name=""dag2"",job=""Airflow""} 0.343803


So I debugged some time and found out that this issue is only related to the gauge export. If the metric is a counter the label export works fine.

The issue is that the gauge value is created as an ObserveableGauge and with that OTEL uses a callback to collect the metric. For this OTEL python lib creates intruments to handle the metric. The down side of this is that if a second Observable instrument with the same metric name is created, OTEL will only create one instrument because it checks for the metric name. 
This results in the issue that only the callback for the first registered metric will be executed and all other metrics with different label but same name will be ignored.
My idea is now to switch to an syncronos gauge export of the metric like it is used for the counter export. 

I´m not sure why the ObserveableGauge was used but I did not found a solution to fix the issue without switching to sync gauge export.
Also not sure about any down side of using sync gauge, like maybe runtime, but for the counter metric export sync was also used. Anyone has more know how in that area and give feedback for this?

# Details of changes:
* Use of normal sync Gauge instead of ObservedGauge.
* Moved logic to handle gauge into InternalGauge class.

2834835401,pull_request,open,,Add recent runs duration chart.,"This uses the API to get recent 14 dag runs to plot the chart along with average of the run and queued duration as annotations. The size is 1/3 since there will be 2 more for success/failed rate and grouped durations as per design. This is for initial implementation and might not completely cover all use cases like Airflow 2 but can be taken up in subsequent PRs or separate issues for them as below. If approved a similar overview page can be created for task page as well in another PR for task duration.

Notes to self and review 

1. It seems `stateColor.ts` was removed. What is the recommended way to show color based on state for a given theme?
2. Legend is not implemented now where in Airflow 2 it can be selected to show only those values.
3. Duration is now in seconds and conversion to other units is yet to be implemented.
4. x axis value is set to 3 since high number causes values to render vertically amidst smaller space.
5. landing times based toggle is not implemented yet.
6. Clicking on dagrun to take to the run page is not implemented yet.
7. Autorefresh is not yet implemented.
8. It seems even with limit of 14 passed more dagruns are returned. Changing it manually reflects correct value. Need to see if there is some cache issue.

2834267988,pull_request,open,,Migrate Amazon provider package,"Provider tests pass but there are many issues (after fixing a handful of failures related to paths being used in tests which needed updating):

### 1) mypy failures:
Example: 
```traceback
providers/amazon/src/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/operators/bedrock.py:358: error:
Value of type ""Optional[dict[str, Any]]"" is not indexable  [index]
            if event[""status""] != ""success"":
```

We have a helper `validate_execute_complete_event(event)` to check if the event is None, for this exact reason. Which was working perfectly fine before the migration but is now failing type checking locally for me on all operators.


### 2) docs

There are many _api docs which either seem out of date or have spelling errors that seem to already be fixed. I do not know how to generate these docs. I tried a docs build but that fails because all paths to system test examples are now incorrect. I'm not sure if this is something unique to amazon, or if the migration script failed (there were some issues related to the `aws` directory within the `amazon` provider).

### 3) there are many bits of code that have not been static checked for issues of spelling and words like ""master"". I've fixed most but some are in places that are difficult to change.

It might - of course - cause a ripple effect and MyPy complaining about something else, but it\'s worth trying if you do not want to `fix` the way things are implemented now. Because I personally think that redefining type of the variable like that is a bit fishy (that\'s why also it\'s not enabled by default by MyPY) - I would rather create another variable (`coerced_event` would be a good name) and use this one instead of `event` - but If you do not want to refactor it in all those places (should be relatively easy with IntelliJ or VSCode refactoring - just rename the variable with refactor and bring `event` back in the method signature  and `validate_execute_complete_event` method call without refactoring. Yep. A bit ""dull"" change, and will take about 10-15 minutes of time to change it in all those places, but possibly it\'s worth it. \r\n\r\n> 2) docs\r\n> There are many _api docs which either seem out of date or have spelling errors that seem to already be fixed. I do not know how to generate these docs. I tried a docs build but that fails because all paths to system test examples are now incorrect. I\'m not sure if this is something unique to amazon, or if the migration script failed (there were some issues related to the aws directory within the amazon provider).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately when `autoapi` generates API docs and fails, no API docs are generated and then you can have many unrelated errors about missing docs.  Not much we can do about it. \r\n\r\nThis is how sphinx/autoapi works. The errors are likely coming from just a few failing docstring generation by autoapi - likely those last errors are the root cause - those classes are referred to in some docstrings you just need to fin them: `tests.system.providers.amazon.aws.example_appflow_run.create_s3_to_s3_flow`. The migration script does not handle **all** cases. It handled ""most common cases"" - 95% of those - simply those that could be easily automated, common for all operators and are not risky - does not require human to diagnose and fix those. The rest of fixes for providers have to be done manually. That\'s one of the tasks when migrating provider to identify and fix those remaing 5%. \r\n\r\nIf we could 100% migrate all providers, I would not ask others for help, I would just run the scripts myself. Unfortunately, with inter-relations between providers, doc generation and others, automating absolutely all cases would take likely far more effort of one person to track, identify and fix and especially automate those. The premise was that individuals looking at those will do it much faster (and in parallel or at different times) - also that their involvement in helping to move will make it more of a ""community"" effort. Which pretty much worked so far. \r\n\r\n> 2) there are many bits of code that have not been static checked for issues of spelling and words\r\n\r\nYep. We are well aware that things are not always fixable for those. There are exclusions in .pre-commit-config.yaml for thsoe. Likely those need to be moved.

potiuk on (2025-02-06 19:31:52 UTC): I think you need to rebase and resolve conflicts @o-nikolas - in order to trigger tests. 

BTW. The mypy `satisfying` (I prefer that name ;) change looks good.

o-nikolas (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-06 19:47:24 UTC): Agreed, I'm already working on the rebase but it's a bit of a nasty one! Lots of stuff touches the amazone provider package :cry: 

I have a busy day today as well, so I'm only making bits of progress here and there as I have time

potiuk on (2025-02-06 20:03:02 UTC): Yeah. Amazon is a beast :)

o-nikolas (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-06 22:38:48 UTC): Updates so far:
- I have fixed the original mypy issues and also many more that have cropped up (I'm not quite sure what's causing more to show up)
- I have done a rebase which need some handholding
- I have fixed most of the breeze tests (**code not yet pushed**). I have two left. It is tricky because I don't quite know how to run them locally, so cannot use a debugger.

potiuk on (2025-02-08 16:57:49 UTC): That looks way better now :) -> only small/easy things seems to be remaining :)

potiuk on (2025-02-08 17:00:24 UTC): Super easy: breeze is just standard Python package with `pyproject.toml` etc. 

1) cd ./dev/breeze/
2) Run `uv sync`
3) Use the `.venv` generated there as your project's Python venv
4) Mark `src` directory (if you are using intellij) as sources and `tests` as tests
5) Run tests same way as other tests
6) CLI is `uv run pytest tests` when you are in `dev/breeze`


It's absolutley 100% standard Python project - but just placed in `dev/breeze` folder

o-nikolas (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-09 05:18:27 UTC): Thanks! I ended up figuring out a similar way of doing it after a little while, accelerated a lot of debugging!

2834200218,pull_request,closed,,"Update `create_emr_on_eks_cluster` method to try when ""cluster is not reachable as its connection is currently being updated""","The AWS system test `example_emr_eks.py` started to fail because of the error below:

```
botocore.errorfactory.ValidationException: An error occurred (ValidationException) when calling the CreateVirtualCluster operation: Cluster XXX is not reachable as its connection is currently being updated
```

This error happens when trying to create the virtual cluster on EMR. The creation of this virtual cluster happens after creating the EKS cluster and waiting for its status to be active.  After some testing, the creation succeeds after waiting few seconds between the creation of the EKS cluster and the virtual cluster. It must be a race condition. Retrying is the only option here since there is no notion of cluster connection status in EKS.

I also revert the change I did in #46441 because it did not help (it just happened to succeed when I changed the version, but it was a fluke ...).

This makes https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/45732 the obvious candidate but that was merged a couple days ago, we shouldve seen the failures earlier.

But, https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44986 was merged recently which doesn't allow extra fields in any datamodels, due to which the fields added in the previous PR started screaming.

This PR updates the fields in task sdk datamodels.

The `ocsp_fail_open` parameter defaults to `True` inside of the driver when the snowflake-connector version is 1.8.0 or later. So the usual case for overriding the setting will be providing a `False` value. That is different than other flags (where we only pass through `True`), so you may notice some difference in the flag handling.

Also, for building the sqlalchemy engine, this parameter needs to be passed in as part of `connect_args`.

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contributors' Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/README.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (ruff, mypy and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/08_static_code_checks.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/docs/apache-airflow/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/doc/README.rst) for testing locally, it's a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent.

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contributors' Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/README.rst)
Here are some useful points:
- Pay attention to the quality of your code (ruff, mypy and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/08_static_code_checks.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.
- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/docs/apache-airflow/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.
- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/doc/README.rst) for testing locally, it's a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.
- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.
- Please follow [ASF Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct) for all communication including (but not limited to) comments on Pull Requests, Mailing list and Slack.
- Be sure to read the [Airflow Coding style]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#coding-style-and-best-practices).
- Always keep your Pull Requests rebased, otherwise your build might fail due to changes not related to your commits.
Apache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.
In case of doubts contact the developers at:
Mailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org
Slack: https://s.apache.org/airflow-slack

jcrobak (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-05 20:56:17 UTC): Thanks for the review @potiuk !! The build failed with:

```
The image /mnt/ci-image-save-linux_amd64-3.9.tar does not exist.
```

during the ""Prepare breeze & CI Image: 3.9"" step of [Lowest direct dependency providers tests / All-core:LowestDeps-Postgres:13:3.9](https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/13162285492/job/36745165887#logs).

I don't think this is related to this change, so I have rebased to see if it can pick up any fixes for main. Do you mind kicking off the CI again?

boring-cyborg[bot] on (2025-02-05 22:02:04 UTC): Awesome work, congrats on your first merged pull request! You are invited to check our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues) for additional contributions.

Use name based on python callable in `@task.kubernetes` pod name generation 

- generate specific pod name base by provided python callable
- drop uuid usage with no name (random is controlled by `random_name_suffix` arg, there is no need for extra UUID usage)
- add specific pod naming tests for decorator flow because decorator distinguishes between `name=None` and no `name` argument provided

If user has disabled name randomization  by `random_name_suffix=False` -- that's more on user side to ensure name uniqueness.

2832464594,pull_request,closed,,Add update XCom endpoint in RestAPI,"related: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/45966

Debugging Airflow workflows often involves dealing with incorrect or missing XCom values, which can cause tasks to fail or behave unexpectedly. 
Traditionally, fixing such issues requires rerunning tasks, modifying Dag logic, or even manually editing the Airflow metadata database—none of which are ideal in a production setting. With API-based XCom updates, users can quickly correct erroneous values without restarting entire workflows. 
This is especially useful in long-running jobs, where reprocessing can be costly, or in dependency-heavy pipelines, where a single incorrect value can block multiple downstream tasks. By allowing targeted updates, this feature speeds up debugging, reduces downtime, and ensures smoother workflow execution.

-----------------------------------

### Steps to play around the feature.

Add the following Dag.
```
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
import time

def push_xcom_value(ti):
    value_to_push = ""Hello from XCom!""
    ti.xcom_push(key='my_key', value=value_to_push)
    time.sleep(60)  # Wait for 1 minute, meanwhile you can update the XCom via API

def pull_xcom_value(ti):
    pulled_value = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='push_task', key='my_key')
    print(f""Pulled Value: {pulled_value}"") # Updated value should be present

default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'catchup': False,
    'start_date': datetime(2024, 2, 5),
}

dag = DAG(
    'xcom_push_pull_dag',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='A simple DAG to demonstrate XCom push and pull',
    catchup=False,
)

push_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='push_task',
    python_callable=push_xcom_value,
    dag=dag,
)

pull_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='pull_task',
    python_callable=pull_xcom_value,
    dag=dag,
)

push_task >> pull_task

```
As soon as push_task has pushed to xcom, just update the value via API.

This PR moves https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/tests/models/test_dag.py#L2522-L2648 to the task sdk tests:

 - some are under task runner as we are checking some runtime behaviour with tasks too

If and edge worker is shut down and removed, it is not cleared from the database. Therefore it will be visible on the edge worker hosts page for ever, even if it is not used anymore, making the worker list longer and harder to read.
This PR adds an option to the UI to delete that worker from the database.
Also, proper csrf handling is added to the maintenance mode as fix.

2831420598,pull_request,closed,,Refactor dag processor for code clarity,"Dag processor has experienced a lot of organic growth over the years and had gotten into a state where it became a bit hard to understand.  E.g. method `set_files` did not have a name that clearly indicated its purpose. And that's probably in part because it did a bunch of things and was called in a bunch of places.  I simplify that method and focus on just one aspect of its prior work, namely handling removed files, and call it `handle_removed_files`.

A lot of the behavior was driven by a data structure on the instance called file paths.  This contained all known files.  It's one thing that was modified in `set_files`.  From looking at the main loop it was not obvious where this structure was being used or modified.  So I made it a local variable instead of instance attr. And now we can easily see all the methods that are using it because it must be passed around.

I rename the `file_paths` to known_files because that is clearer about its meaning.  Previously it was file_paths and file_queue -- harder to understand the different purposes.  I make file_paths a dictionary because then it's easier to replace all the files in the bundle, something that was previously done by iterating through the files. 

In prepare file paths, I pull out the mtime mode logic into its own method because it's quite involved and made the prepare file paths method too big and complicated.  Along with this I simplify the logic to not exclude recently processed files if they were recently changed.

In some of the tests, I had to change the way we simulated mtime numbers because the input is now a set which does not guarantee order.  So I encode the mtime in the filename in the test.  And the one test dealing with zip file, this was apparently a flakey test.  I change it so we don't mock anything but just copy the file to a tmp dir and make a bundle there, then remove it and see what happens.

This PR implements a PEP 249-like cursor (e.g. ElasticsearchSQLCursor) so the ElasticsearchSQLHook (which is a specialization of the DbApiHook) can be used through the SQLExecuteQueryOperator.

The issue is that the TestElasticsearchSQLHook mocks the cursor and thus gives the impression the ESConnection has a cursor available which is internally used by the run method of the DbApiHook but in reality doesn't exist, this means at runtime the SQLExecuteQueryOperator will fail.

Just noticed the comment - https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/46132#issuecomment-2634622838

bugraoz93 on (2025-02-04 22:48:47 UTC): One of the docs is failing due to a path showing old system tests. `apache-airflow/tutorial/taskflow.rst`

jason810496 (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-05 06:46:42 UTC): The remain errors are caused by `tests/always/test_project_structure.py::TestCncfProviderProjectStructure::test_missing_examples`  and import error for `airflow.providers.cncf` in `kubernetes_tests/test_kubernetes_pod_operator.py`.

```
kubernetes_tests/test_kubernetes_pod_operator.py:39: in <module>
    from airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.hooks.kubernetes import KubernetesHook
E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'airflow.providers.cncf'
```

I tried updating the path in `tests/always/test_project_structure.py`, replacing `providers/tests/cncf/kubernetes/` with `providers/cncf/kubernetes/tests/provider_tests/cncf/kubernetes/`, and ran the test locally, but it still fails.

I'm also unsure why the import in `kubernetes_tests/test_kubernetes_pod_operator.py` is failing, might need some hints on how to fix these errors. 🙏

rawwar on (2025-02-05 07:04:35 UTC): @jason810496 , which failing test has this import error? I checked failing tests and don't see any import errors. Can you share the link to the failing test? or is it happening locally?

jason810496 (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-05 07:06:22 UTC): All the k8s tests encounter the import error. e.g. https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/13149821313/job/36695881525?pr=46436

rawwar on (2025-02-05 07:08:22 UTC): Ah sorry. I just realised you mentioned about two issues. I resolved the issue with example_dag in google provider. looking into it. Not sure about k8s tests. Will look at it after example dag tests

rawwar on (2025-02-05 07:16:59 UTC): @jason810496 , I noticed that adding

```
MISSING_EXAMPLES_FOR_CLASSES = {
        ""src.airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.operators.job.KubernetesDeleteJobOperator""
    }
```

to TestCncfProviderProjectStructure and that's ignoring the issues.  But, in actual, test for the class is present at `airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/tests/provider_tests/cncf/kubernetes/operators/test_job.py`

So, issue is definitely with the src prefix in the import path. That's a direction to look into?


EDIT: I suspect issue is because of the way we find example dags at https://github.com/rawwar/airflow/blob/4821da5cc3fe58e1f64d49967b52026adfa89dbe/tests/always/test_project_structure.py#L307

rawwar on (2025-02-05 07:28:12 UTC): Ok, so, the issue is that PROVIDER is set to `cncf`  in https://github.com/rawwar/airflow/blob/4821da5cc3fe58e1f64d49967b52026adfa89dbe/tests/always/test_project_structure.py#L288

because of that, its unable to find the example dags

jason810496 (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-05 07:32:04 UTC): I just replaced the `PROVIDER = ""cncf""` with `PROVIDER = ""cncf/kubernetes""` and ran the test, but it still fail.
https://github.com/rawwar/airflow/blob/4821da5cc3fe58e1f64d49967b52026adfa89dbe/tests/always/test_project_structure.py#L571

UPDATED:
The test fail due to:
```
{'src.airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.operators.spark_kubernetes.SparkKubernetesOperator': <ast.ClassDef object at 0xffffb0c46910>}
Classes with missing examples:
    src.airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.operators.job.KubernetesDeleteJobOperator
    src.airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.operators.job.KubernetesJobOperator
    src.airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.operators.job.KubernetesPatchJobOperator

    src.airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.operators.spark_kubernetes.SparkKubernetesOperator
    src.airflow.providers.cncf.kubernetes.sensors.spark_kubernetes.SparkKubernetesSensor
FAILED
```
I think by adding `MISSING_EXAMPLES_FOR_CLASSES` set will resolve this error.

rawwar on (2025-02-05 07:35:42 UTC): I was actually checking. I see example tests at `airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/tests/system/cncf/kubernetes/example_kubernetes_job.py`. 

Somehow, these aren't being imported

EDIT: Issue is definitely because of https://github.com/rawwar/airflow/blob/4821da5cc3fe58e1f64d49967b52026adfa89dbe/tests/always/test_project_structure.py#L243

Only for this provider, its prefixed with `src.`. I checked google tests and I don't see `src.` being prefixed. fixing that should resolve the issues

rawwar on (2025-02-05 08:09:48 UTC): So, the actual issue for the example test is at https://github.com/rawwar/airflow/blob/4821da5cc3fe58e1f64d49967b52026adfa89dbe/tests/always/test_project_structure.py#L272

Here we just split and consider from 2nd index. since, its `cncf.kubernetes.src`  in this case, its failing. This needs to be fixed. Maybe later or in this PR


On to K8s failing tests

rawwar on (2025-02-05 08:24:58 UTC): @jason810496 , raised a separate pr - https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/46454 . that might handle it. Locally, tests passed . looking into k8s tests failure

rawwar on (2025-02-05 09:37:38 UTC): it looks like https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/46454 also fixes K8s tests. I just ran them locally and they passed

jason810496 (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-05 09:50:25 UTC): If then, I will revert the last commit and wait for #46454 be merged. Big thanks to @rawwar !

rawwar on (2025-02-05 09:51:52 UTC): Can you pull the changes from the PR? these k8s tests didn't run on the other PR. Once you pull, we can at least confirm that the changes fix the k8s tests.

rawwar on (2025-02-05 13:19:32 UTC): So, the only other fix required here for the example tests is to make providers = ""cncf/kubernetes"". 

But, k8s tests are still failing. I just raised a [dummy pr](https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/13157601342/job/36720083829?pr=46461) to see the test results and they failed. Locally, They are successful.

potiuk on (2025-02-05 19:09:25 UTC): @jason810496 -> the k8s tests here are failing because you need to modify `scripts/ci/kubernetes/k8s_requirements.txt` -> You need to add this:

```
-e ./providers/cncf/kubernetes
```

jason810496 (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-06 06:55:12 UTC): The import error has finally been resolved! Big thanks to @potiuk! 

The only remaining CI failures:  
- **Additional PROD image tests**  
  - **Docker Compose quick start with PROD image**  
    - `upstream_failed` in `docker_tests/test_docker_compose_quick_start.py::test_trigger_dag_and_wait_for_result`  
- **K8s tests**  
  - `upstream_failed` or `failed` for both `CeleryExecutor` and `LocalExecutor`.  

Not sure if rerunning the tests would resolve these errors.

potiuk on (2025-02-06 07:57:21 UTC): Those are tests failing in main now - due to some `task_sdk`  errors and there are other PRs that should already fix them https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/46492 - merged after your change, so rebasing should fix them. Let me try it.

potiuk on (2025-02-06 14:08:59 UTC): Ah... You need to rebase :( there are some changes merged in the meantime. Sorry :( 

But we are REALLY close.

jason810496 (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-06 14:20:28 UTC): Hope this one will be the last one to be green  🚀 🟢

potiuk on (2025-02-06 16:43:28 UTC): Ah.. For some reason you have all teh `_api` files generated added to that PR @jason810496 -> you should remove them!

jason810496 (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-06 16:46:00 UTC): Do you mean all the docs prefix with `_api` should be removed ?

potiuk on (2025-02-06 16:48:44 UTC): Yep. I have not seen you are around - just pushed that fixup.

Yeah. The `_api` docs are generated automatically when docs are being built and they should be `.gitignored` in general - but they were added in this PR.

potiuk on (2025-02-06 17:33:37 UTC): Wooho.

jason810496 (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-06 17:35:56 UTC): Greatly appreciate it, thanks @potiuk! 🙌🎉

2830547428,pull_request,closed,,Fix ownership of files that docker uses in mounted directories,"The #46358 moved docker to another mounted directory - but this directory and all files in it are owned by host user. The directory and all files inside should be owned by root in order to properly reflect permissions of the files when building docker images.

The change is now simplified. Rather than passing mount directory by variable and passing it through GitHub Actions, we hard-code the location of docker in cleanup_docker.sh script - we also incorporate changing ownership and showing disk space in the same cleanup_docker.sh script and make sure that script is only called in the ""real"" (not composite) actions at the beginning - right after the repository is checked out - previously that script was also called in composite actions and changing the repo to be writeable was done AFTER cleanup_docker.sh - which would not work as we want the /mnt directory to be still owned by the host user, but the docker storage should be still owned by root.

When a Databricks job fails, it's expected the task instance will also fail. If the operator is configured as `deferrable=True` and the Databricks job already failed before defer, it should raise an error, as done in the `_handle_databricks_operator_execution` so the task instance will also fail.

The `_handle_deferrable_databricks_operator_execution` function wasn't raising this error, so when the Databricks job failed before defer, it would only finish successfully, opposed from the expected.

As part of https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/ff7e70056e5b4e6e61d20215eec00054415d4a77, I had realised that there is an issue in the way tuples were handled and I had made a change for that:


To quote from that commit:
- Handling special case of `tuples` - they are json serialisable but we used to store them as lists when passed as tuples, because of usage of json.dumps(). It has been made like this now:
```
    def is_jsonable(x):
        try:
            json.dumps(x)
            if isinstance(x, tuple):
                # Tuple is converted to list in json.dumps
                # so while it is jsonable, it changes the type which might be a surprise
                # for the user, so instead we return False here -- which will convert it to string
                return False
```

Historically, all tuples in RTIF were converted to lists and this PR is bringing back that behaviour. It is just more natural to do that. So no major impact to anyone who is using it, if its a pure tuple, it will be kept as a tuple, if nested, it will be list-ified.

## Testing Results
1. Simple DAG:
```
import sys
from time import sleep

from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.standard.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from airflow.exceptions import AirflowTaskTimeout


def print_hello(*args):
    print(args)

with DAG(
    dag_id=""atul_rendered"",
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
    tags=[""demo""],
) as dag:
    PythonOperator(
        task_id=""matts_assert"",
        python_callable=print_hello,
        op_args=[(""a"", ""b"", ""c"")]
    )
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5fb470d-599b-4f90-9956-d46c09f5d2cb)



2. Slightly more nested DAG:
```
import sys
from time import sleep

from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.standard.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from airflow.exceptions import AirflowTaskTimeout


def print_hello(*args):
    print(args)

with DAG(
    dag_id=""atul_rendered"",
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False,
    tags=[""demo""],
) as dag:
    PythonOperator(
        task_id=""matts_assert"",
        python_callable=print_hello,
        op_args=[
            [(""t0.task_id"", ""t1.task_id"", ""branch one""),
             (""t0.task_id"", ""t2.task_id"", ""branch two""),
             (""t0.task_id"", ""t3.task_id"", ""branch three"")
             ]]

If the edge worker was shut down it should remember that it was in maintenance mode, and in the next startup it should remain in maintenance mode. 
There is a new state introduced: ""offline maintenance"". If the _EdgeWorkerCli.maintenance_mode flag is True, then the worker will be set to this state during shut down. Then on startup maintenance request will be in the database instead of starting. That way the worker will jump to maintenance mode.

That all makes sense that it is then not a 4xx as the XCom value is ""broken"" in the DB and can not be de-serialized.

I propose to handle functional problems in a different error code to skip retry.

If you reduce it as here in the PR, please make it configurable at least such that we can increase it back to 10 attempts, else I fear it will lower the stability when moving to Task SDK.

400 Bad Request would be correct in this case.

I think 400 is more ideal.

The part of code that returns 500:

    if result is None:

                ""reason"": ""not_found"",
                ""message"": f""XCom with key '{key}' not found for task '{task_id}' in DAG '{dag_id}'"",
            },
        )

    try:
        xcom_value = BaseXCom.orm_deserialize_value(result)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
            detail={
                ""reason"": ""invalid_format"",
                ""message"": ""XCom value is not a valid JSON"",
            },
        )

    return XComResponse(key=key, value=xcom_value)
```


As observed in:
```
   try:
        xcom_value = BaseXCom.orm_deserialize_value(result)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
            detail={
                ""reason"": ""invalid_format"",
                ""message"": ""XCom value is not a valid JSON"",
            },
        )
```

Here, `result` is also something that comes from the server. So, the issue is actually is at the server end and not the client. 400 would be ideal if there's some issue with what the client sent, 4xx stands for client side errors. 

Does that make sense?

jscheffl on (2025-02-05 20:21:07 UTC): Sorry for the delayed response. That all makes sense that it is then not a 4xx as the XCom value is ""broken"" in the DB and can not be de-serialized. I would ask myself how it got in there but... 500 also gives me the impression that something on the server side is ""broken"". But also restarting does not help. The given data point is corrupt.

Question for me would be, in case we can not de-serialize... should we directly delete it? Or do we keep it for manual recovery?

If it would be deleted to clean broken stuff, then HTTP 410 might be fitting to purpose.

Otherwise following the discussion in https://www.bennadel.com/blog/2434-http-status-codes-for-invalid-data-400-vs-422.htm I assume 422 might be a good response code to signal this error. Even if it is a server content issue and not a client issue. I see no 5xx error code which would be matching otherwise. Even if in general a 5xx error would fir better from problem domain.

static and unit tests pass. 

This provider required changes to the new provider schema to add back support for excluded python versions which cloudant makes use of (see comment annotations for more details).  The release management scripts for generating project toml files also needed updating.

This update revises the documentation for worker_refresh_batch_size to clearly state:

""Number of workers to refresh at a time through Gunicorn's built-in worker management. When set to 0, worker refresh is disabled. When nonzero, Airflow periodically refreshes webserver workers by bringing up new ones and killing old ones.""

The change aims to eliminate ambiguity by clarifying that Gunicorn reload and webserver refresh refer to the same underlying mechanism. Previously, these terms could be misinterpreted as distinct functions or mistaken for auto_refresh_interval, leading to confusion. By emphasizing that both phenomena are part of Gunicorn's worker management strategy, users will have a clearer understanding of how Airflow manages webserver workers.

Add try/except for sql alchemy engine creation used in some google cloud operators (not in SQLExecuteQueryOperator). It's used only for query compilation within sql parser and it's not required, so i think this is reasonable. This issue came out when using CloudSQLExecuteQuery operator, and this is a quick fix before release happens.

2826917545,pull_request,closed,,Optimize CI image build step,"The image has been using the same disk for building the image and to export the mount cache - which caused some problems in main builds where the build run out of disk space.

There are a few changes here:

* mount cache is stored in /mnt directory - separately from the root directory where docker storage is

* disk stats are displayed more often to see how much disk is used during the build steps

* we also display docker buildx stats to show how much space is used by docker buildx

* environment variables are moved to the JOB so that they are not set in multiple places

* only env variables are used in bash commands to avoid potential template injections (as suggested by zizmor)

2825991617,pull_request,closed,,Fix disk space issues on github runners,"Main is failing e.g. in https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/13101805105/job/36550974189 as runners are ""out of disk space"".
This seems to be caused as only 23GB are free on /root disk where main artifacts like docker is produced. When the runner starts the following disk space is available:
```
Run df -H
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/root        78G   56G   23G  72% /
tmpfs           8.4G  177k  8.4G   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs           3.4G  1.2M  3.4G   1% /run
tmpfs           5.3M     0  5.3M   0% /run/lock
/dev/sda15      110M  6.4M  104M   6% /boot/efi
/dev/sdb1        79G  4.3G   71G   6% /mnt
tmpfs           1.7G   13k  1.7G   1% /run/user/1001
```
(A lot of build tools are already on CI image - see more debug info from the additional debug steps in https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/13102704519/job/36552932758 where the disk space onthe image is allocated.)

...but this means that after building the image only ~5GB are free and in some corner cases (e.g. main) the build fails. Disk space at then of building pipelines is:
```
Run df -H
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/root        78G   73G  5.2G  94% /
tmpfs           8.4G  177k  8.4G   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs           3.4G  1.2M  3.4G   1% /run
tmpfs           5.3M     0  5.3M   0% /run/lock
/dev/sdb15      110M  6.4M  104M   6% /boot/efi
/dev/sda1        79G  8.2G   67G  11% /mnt
tmpfs           1.7G   13k  1.7G   1% /run/user/1001
```

...and as it seems a LOT of disk space is on the second drive in /mnt and the larged data chunk from triaging is the docker workspace, this PR adds a bind mout to use the second drive in /var/lib/docker. With this at the end of the build of the image the following free space is available:
```
Run df -H
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/root        78G   54G   25G  69% /
tmpfs           8.4G  177k  8.4G   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs           3.4G  1.2M  3.4G   1% /run
tmpfs           5.3M     0  5.3M   0% /run/lock
/dev/sda15      110M  6.4M  104M   6% /boot/efi

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contributors' Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/README.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (ruff, mypy and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/08_static_code_checks.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/docs/apache-airflow/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/doc/README.rst) for testing locally, it's a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\n- Please follow [ASF Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct) for all communication including (but not limited to) comments on Pull Requests, Mailing list and Slack.\n- Be sure to read the [Airflow Coding style]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#coding-style-and-best-practices).\n- Always keep your Pull Requests rebased, otherwise your build might fail due to changes not related to your commits.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://s.apache.org/airflow-slack"", 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2025, 2, 1, 14, 37, 50, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)}, {'comment_id': 2628981301, 'issue_id': 2825245706, 'author': 'potiuk', 'body': 'Please do not create noise in Airflow by creating educational PRs.

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contributors' Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/README.rst)
Here are some useful points:
- Pay attention to the quality of your code (ruff, mypy and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/08_static_code_checks.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.
- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/docs/apache-airflow/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.
- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/doc/README.rst) for testing locally, it's a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.
- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.
- Please follow [ASF Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct) for all communication including (but not limited to) comments on Pull Requests, Mailing list and Slack.
- Be sure to read the [Airflow Coding style]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#coding-style-and-best-practices).
- Always keep your Pull Requests rebased, otherwise your build might fail due to changes not related to your commits.
Apache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.
In case of doubts contact the developers at:
Mailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org
Slack: https://s.apache.org/airflow-slack

potiuk on (2025-02-01 14:48:26 UTC): Please do not create noise in Airflow by creating educational PRs. You can work on your private repo.

Can you please explain - did someone tell you in some instructions how to create the PRs and forgot to mention that you shoudl not create an issue in Airflow repo? We received similar PR from another person just recently but it did not happen before. Can you please explain where the idea of creating PR in airflow repo came from?

deneshvarma22 (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-01 15:01:38 UTC): Hi Jarek,

Apologies for the confusion. I mistakenly created a PR in the Apache
Airflow repository while learning about Airflow and GitHub integration.

I will make sure to work in my own private repository and avoid making
unnecessary PRs in the official repo.

Thanks for letting me know!

Regards,

Dinesh

Note, that we don't enforce that this is set when it needs to be on the server side, as the only way for us to know if we need to or not (and conversely, when it's set when it _doesn't_ need to, which is no effect other than creating a small DB row that nothing will ever read) as doing that would involve loading the serialized DAG to walk the structure which is a relatively expensive operation.

We could improve that by ""pre-computing"" some of the info on what tasks are actually mapped or not before serialization so we wouldn't have to walk the task groups to find out, but that wouldn't do anything about the need to load the serialized DAG which is the expensive part.

If this turns out to be a problem to not be enforcing this  is passed when required we can revisit the decision later.

When a Databricks job fails, it's expected the task instance will also fail. If the operator is configured as `deferrable=True` and the Databricks job already failed before defer, it should raise an error, as done in the `_handle_databricks_operator_execution` so the task instance will also fail.

The `_handle_deferrable_databricks_operator_execution` function wasn't raising this error, so when the Databricks job failed before defer, it would only finish successfully, opposed from the expected.

Unfortunately this broke `prepare_file_path_queue` which only showed up in the Kube integration tests, not in this PR (due to selective tests, which 99.9% of the time is fine to not run for this sort of change)

The error we saw was:

```

And while that change was easy enough to fix, (`path` -> `relpath`) I wasn't happy ""just"" fixing that path without some kind of tests/checks, so I also added typing here:

```python
        file_paths: list[DagFileInfo] = []
```

I noticed this as I use basedpyright in my editor which type checks functions even when the signature has no typing.
Adding a `-> None:` on the function so mypy type checks it, and then suddenly we get all these errors:

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41363 is a feature that heavily relied on pydantic models of AIP 44 to do some serialisation magic.

Historically did this: 
```
            if self.use_airflow_context:
                from airflow.serialization.serialized_objects import BaseSerialization

                context = get_current_context()
                with create_session() as session:
                    # FIXME: DetachedInstanceError
                    dag_run, task_instance = context[""dag_run""], context[""task_instance""]
                    session.add_all([dag_run, task_instance])
                    serializable_context: dict[Encoding, Any] = BaseSerialization.serialize(
                        context, use_pydantic_models=True
                    )
```

- So it used a pydantic model to serialize the DAG.
- And the mapping looked like so:
```
_type_to_class: dict[DAT | str, list] = {
    DAT.BASE_JOB: [JobPydantic, Job],
    DAT.TASK_INSTANCE: [TaskInstancePydantic, TaskInstance],
    DAT.DAG_RUN: [DagRunPydantic, DagRun],
    DAT.DAG_MODEL: [DagModelPydantic, DagModel],
    DAT.LOG_TEMPLATE: [LogTemplatePydantic, LogTemplate],
    DAT.DATA_SET: [DatasetPydantic, Dataset],
    DAT.TRIGGER: [TriggerPydantic, Trigger],
}
```
- And this:
```
def serialize_operator(x: DAG) -> dict:
    from airflow.serialization.serialized_objects import SerializedDAG

    return SerializedDAG.serialize_dag(x)


def validate_operator(x: DAG | dict[str, Any], _info: ValidationInfo) -> Any:
    from airflow.serialization.serialized_objects import SerializedDAG

    if isinstance(x, DAG):
        return x
    return SerializedDAG.deserialize_dag(x)
```

Since now we do not have the pydantic models of AIP 44 AND the fact that this didnt make it to any release, now is a time to chop it off.

2822840687,pull_request,open,,refactor: add `STRAIGHT_JOIN` prefix for MySQL query optimization in `get_sorted_triggers`,"This PR adds a `STRAIGHT_JOIN` hint to prevent an unintended full scan in `get_sorted_triggers`.

With MySQL backend, if there are many records in the `trigger`, it causes the `task_instance` to be scanned first as the driving table, leading to slow queries.

To test this, I stopped the `triggerer` process to keep it unassigned first, and generated some dummy data, as shown below:

```python
from airflow.models.trigger import Trigger
from airflow.utils.session import NEW_SESSION, provide_session

@provide_session
def add_trigger(session=NEW_SESSION):
    for _ in range(10):
        session.add(Trigger(classpath="""", kwargs={""key"": ""value""}))
    session.commit()

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    add_trigger()
```

With the following 10 records where the triggerer is not assigned:

```sql
MySQL [airflow]> SELECT * FROM `trigger`;

The logic to check for task inlets, outlets in task runner had unwanted code branching - if, else when it could have been simpler. (Yea, i wrote the initial code, but didnt realise that time :)).

This PR simplifies that part by keeping only the `if` and adding a finally. Additionally, renamed `msg` that received `OKResponse` as `ok_response` to not confuse with the actual message from supervsior.

Extended the tests for OK = true as well as false.

MongoClient is stored in the Hook and hooks/test_mongo.py stored the hook as object in the test class, which means that the thread has not been torn down and continued to run after mongo tests completed.

Subsequently any test that was mocking time.sleep (and skipping waiting) had been spammed by mongo client thread calling sleep() - potentially many times.

Earlier attempts to fix this had not succeeded - so they are reverted now as part of this PR, as the original patching of sleep was much nicer there.

We've been installing both extras (pandas, tqdm) by other means before - but we should have been using `evaluation` extra before, because we are apparently using it for some operators in Google Provider before - but it has not been noticed, because those deps were already installed by other providers (tqdm is a dependency of fsspec).

2819496666,pull_request,closed,,Swap CeleryExecutor over to use TaskSDK for execution.,"Closes #45426

Some points of note about this PR:

- Logging is changed in Celery, but only for Airflow 3

  Celery does it's own ""capture stdout"" logging, which conflicts with the ones
  we do in the TaskSDK, so we disable that; but to not change anything for
  Airflow 3.

- Simplify task SDK logging redirection

  As part of this discovery that Celery captures stdout/stderr itself (and
  before disabling that) I discovered a simpler way to re-open the
  stdin/out/err so that the implementation needs fewer/no special casing.

- Make JSON task logs more readable by giving them a consistent/useful order

  We re-order (by re-creating) the event_dict so that timestamp, level, and
  then even are always the first items in the dict

- Makes the CeleryExecutor understand the concept of ""workloads"" instead a
  command tuple.

  This change isn't done in the best way, but until Kube executor is swapped
  over (and possibly the other in-tree executors, such as ECS) we need to
  support both styles concurrently.

  The change should be done in such a way that the provider still works with
  Airflow v2, if it's running on that version.

- Upgrade Celery

  This turned out to not be 100% necessary but it does fix some deprecation
  warnings when running on Python 3.12

- Ensure that the forked process in TaskSDK _never ever_ exits

  Again, this isn't possible usually, but since the setup step of `_fork_main`
  died, it didn't call `os._exit()`, and was caught further up, which meant
  the process stayed alive as it never closed the sockets properly. We put and
  extra safety try/except block in place to catch that

I have not yet included a newsfragment for changing the executor interface as
the old style is _currently_ still supported.


Testing: I ran `airflow scheduler`, `airflow fastapi-api`, and `airflow celery
worker` and triggered some dags, viewed logs etc.

And since a picture makes all PRs better

In Airflow 2.10, task logs on the Airflow UI do not use the terminology ""zombie task"" to describe when the heartbeat of a local task job times out. Instead, such events are recorded on the Event Log page as a ""heartbeat timeout"". In order to make troubleshooting such issues more intuitive to Airflow users, the terminology in the documentation should match that in the logs. 

I have added more emphasis to the heartbeat timeout terminology in the documentation so that Airflow users are able to easily find this documentation when they see ""heartbeat timeout"" events and relate the information in the documentation to what they see in the logs.

This PR adds checking OpenLineage events produced by selected Google Provider operators when running system checks. This is an addition to unit tests already checking OpenLineage for specific operators.

Thanks to VariableTransport introduced in #43643, we can easily check if OpenLineage events produced by any operator match the expected values. The logic is simple, for each system tests: adding the OpenLineageTestOperator to the DAG and providing it with json file with what we expect to be in the events. Whenever a system test is run, we will verify OpenLineage events emitted.

We've recently run into an issue where log grooming sidecar containers in our Airflow Kubernetes pods are incurring an absurd amount of transaction costs. That is because the log grooming process runs on a fixed, and for some use cases way too frequent schedule. We've hacked around it for now by overwriting the cleanup shell script in our custom Docker image, but I figured I would add a feature upstream that makes this configurable.

Let me know if there's anything I missed!

If anything it could see it improving because the volumes are not busy listing files all the time. But then again, I'm not super familiar with all the different types of setups Airflow can be run in.

The test expects no handlers on the root logger before `configure_trigger_log_handler()` runs. But the default logging (DEFAULT_LOGGING_CONFIG) seems to automatically attach it to root logger when `configure_logging` is called. 

This PR adds the root logging config specifically to the `fallback_task` hence not altering anything else.

Currently, SFTPOperator only supports PUT and GET operations. With this update, you can now delete files or directories on a remote SFTP server by putting paths in the `remote_filepath` parameter.

NOTE: The `local_filepath` parameter does nothing in DELETE operation even if it's provided

amoghrajesh (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-31 07:33:07 UTC): @potiuk it'd be nice if you can take a look on this too, since you were involved in the past standard operator moves

amoghrajesh (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-31 13:20:16 UTC): @eladkal @ashb got a green CI finally. Can you take a look at this when you have some time?

Lee-W on (2025-02-03 00:52:41 UTC): Yep, we'll need to create a newsfragment for that.

amoghrajesh (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-03 06:14:38 UTC): @vincbeck we will be adding the migration rules for this as requested. @sunank200 / @Lee-W will be assisting with that.

Lee-W on (2025-02-03 06:17:06 UTC): It would still be nice if you could list down the migration rules so that I can focus on the implementation. Thanks!

amoghrajesh (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-03 06:19:49 UTC): Oops bad rebase. FIxing!

eladkal on (2025-02-03 06:52:07 UTC): You can deploy dag in zip files.
I assume that the example dag in that zip contains EmptyOperator

Lee-W on (2025-02-03 06:54:05 UTC): @amoghrajesh Is it possible for us to zip it through script instead of just uploading a zip file? It's hard to know what's actually inside the zip

amoghrajesh (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-03 06:54:14 UTC): It does yeah, it contains a reference to the older EmptyOperator path, i updated that

amoghrajesh (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-03 06:56:58 UTC): Hmm, its been done this way historically too, I guess we can but I can do it in a follow up if thats ok? I will list the zip changes here:
```

```

Lee-W on (2025-02-03 07:03:12 UTC): Yep, I know it's done this way previously. If this is blocking something, we can create an issue for tracking this and do it in follow up PRs. Thanks!

amoghrajesh (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-03 07:04:53 UTC): Yeah, will pick it up @Lee-W.
It isn't related to this change, so better to follow up

Lee-W on (2025-02-04 02:49:51 UTC): @amoghrajesh Sorry for the CI error. The fix is created https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/46404

amoghrajesh (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-04 04:24:27 UTC): No problem, thanks! I was wondering what the issue was!

Lee-W on (2025-02-04 06:07:00 UTC): Feel free to resolve my comments. I think we're close to merge 🙂

The argument ``from_email`` is now an optional kwarg in ``SmtpNotifier``, and the argument ``to`` became the first positional argument.

Configuring the ``SmtpNotifier`` and ``SmtpHook`` default values via Airflow SMTP configurations is not supported anymore. You can instead use the SMTP connection configuration to set the default values, where you can use:

* the connection extra field ``ssl_context`` instead of the configuration ``smtp_provider.ssl_context`` or ``email.ssl_context`` in the SMTP hook.
* the connection extra field ``from_email`` instead of the configuration ``smtp.smtp_mail_from`` in ``SmtpNotifier``.
* the connection extra field ``subject_template`` instead of the configuration ``smtp.templated_email_subject_path`` in ``SmtpNotifier``.

aritra24 (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-29 13:29:58 UTC): The failures do not seem related, @eladkal is there any place I can find out if these are flaky tests or have been failing off late?
I see errors like so, which don't seem related to this pr.
```

aritra24 (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-29 17:45:56 UTC): ~@vincbeck it looks like your change in #45986 might have broken the amazon provider test in 2.9.3 compat? I see the same error on your [pr](https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/12992179539/job/36231951612#step:11:1832) but somehow the ci passed? Could you take a look?~ fixed in #46245

2816365902,pull_request,closed,,Expose security views in Flask application in FAB provider,"All the views under the `security` tab in Airflow 2 are provided by FAB auth manager. These views are: list roles, list users, ... We do not want to re-build these pages in the new UI since, in the future, we want to get rid of FAB auth. The idea is to use these Flask generated views and embed them in the Flask application created in FAB provider. It will probably be confusing for the user because these views use the legacy UI but given we do not want to re-build these pages, this is the only solution we have. 

Technically, these pages are already part of the Flask application, this PR just solves some bugs I found out when trying to access them.

I found [my PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/46073) is wrong to replace `.git` to blank. If url include `.git` the middle(git@myorg.github.com:apache/airflow.git), return `https://myorghub.com:apache/airflow`. Missed it..

All tests in `test_dag_bundles.py` passed

### Why?
DAG Params are needed to provide runtime information to tasks: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/params.html. They are generally useful when you want to provide a per DAG Run level configuration for a dag run, lets say some dynamic information.

These work with legacy Airflow 2 and should be ported over to task sdk.
- The dag params classes from models have been ported over to the task sdk under `definitions` along with changing tests, references, documentation (atleast most of it), and general refs.
- The existing tests continue to run


### Testing

#### Basic Testing
DAG used for testing:
```
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.decorators import task
from airflow.sdk import Param

with DAG(
    ""param_dag"",
    params={
        ""x"": Param(5, type=""integer"", minimum=3),
        ""my_int_param"": 6
    },
) as dag:

    @task
    def example_task():
        # This will print the default value, 6:
        print(dag.params['my_int_param'])


    example_task()
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55d96bf7-10c7-4c89-a422-1e435b69a6ee)


#### Params Trigger UI from example dags
```
from __future__ import annotations

When working on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44306, noticed that we are dumping the model data and recreating ConnectionBody. But, issue here is that we dump the model data, output data will have ""schema_"". when this is passed to the ConnectionBody, its considered as a new filed and is ignored.

bugraoz93 on (2025-01-28 16:51:32 UTC): Thanks for bringing this up! Model Validator approach seems better in this context. I think the implementation of the endpoints shouldn't intervene datamodels in the ideal scenario. 
For the problem in general, do you think if we tweak the validation/serialization alias for datamodels, for example, for connection_id, will the problem still persist?

rawwar (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-29 02:41:52 UTC): At least in the ConnectionBody case, yeah. we can def just use `conn_id`(which is the column in db) instead of `connection_id`. we can just update tests to make it work.

pierrejeambrun on (2025-01-29 15:12:22 UTC): Do you mind highlighting the code snipped that is causing problem ?

Can't we `populate_by_name` ? To allow population by both alias and field name ? so `shema_` and `schema` both are valid.

Here we have connection_id with serialization_alias set to `conn_id`. Hence, we can't use by_alias=True.

pierrejeambrun on (2025-01-29 15:21:04 UTC): I don't know. I don't think we need that in the base model yet. (edited: if the CI is happy with it lets do that)


I was talking about the usage of the model that is causing an issue (in the routes I guess), like where is that a problem ?


I didn't get that. Do you see an error ?

rawwar (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-29 15:25:42 UTC): https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/2f5cfbff3b5bd408d345dee5531b772b3b801bf1/airflow/api_fastapi/core_api/routes/public/connections.py#L188


when we use by_alias=True, it throws the following error. Because, `connection_id` is a required field and because of serilization_alias, model_dump returns it as `conn_id`:

```
'{""detail"":[{""type"":""missing"",""loc"":[""connection_id""],""msg"":""Field required"",""input"":{""conn_id"":""test_connection_id"",""conn_type"":""test_type"",""description"":null,""host"":null,""login"":null,""schema"":null,""port"":null,""password"":null,""extra"":""{\\""key\\"": \\""var\\""}""},""url"":""https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.10/v/missing""},{""type"":""extra_forbidden"",""loc"":[""conn_id""],""msg"":""Extra inputs are not permitted"",""input"":""test_connection_id"",""url"":""https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.10/v/extra_forbidden""}]}'
```

rawwar (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-29 15:32:07 UTC): ~~I think its going to pass. Since, we don't have extra=forbid yet~~

After thinking about above,  I think its irrelevant

- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/docs/apache-airflow/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.
- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/doc/README.rst) for testing locally, it's a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.
- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.
- Please follow [ASF Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct) for all communication including (but not limited to) comments on Pull Requests, Mailing list and Slack.
- Be sure to read the [Airflow Coding style]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#coding-style-and-best-practices).
- Always keep your Pull Requests rebased, otherwise your build might fail due to changes not related to your commits.
Apache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.
In case of doubts contact the developers at:
Mailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org

I’ve been encountering the same traceback since my first push and couldn’t figure it out.  

Should we replace `""uv"", ""run""` in other scripts, even though the only occurrence right now is `""uv"", ""run"", ""airflow"", ""db"", ""reset"", ""--yes""` in `initialize_virtualenv.py`?  
Or is it a good idea to add a `pre-commit` check to prevent passing `""uv"", ""run""` to `subprocess.run`?

In other places `uv run` makes sense actually - there we **expect** airflow venv to be actually created - maybe we will have to tweak it a bit so problematic dependencies that we might have difficulty to build should be excluded by default - but we will see.

2813506988,pull_request,closed,,Fix few issues with constraints generation broken by moving providers,"As part of #46045 we are moving all providers to the new structure, each with it's own pyproject.toml. However we noticed that constraint generation is somewhat broken during the move:

* providers moved to the new structure disappeared from pypi constraints
* http provider in SOME PRs started to appear in ""source constraints""

Both should not happen:

* pypi constraints should contain all providers (latest versions in PyPI)
* source providers should contain no providers - only their dependencies

There are two reasons for those two issues, and this PR fixes both:

1) The PyPI providers were removed because `uv pip install .` without
   editable flag is currently - pretty unexpectedly - installing
   local workspaced providers rather than install them from PyPI and
   there are no controls to disable it.

   Workaround for that is that during constraint generation we
   remove temporarily all providers from workspace definition in the
   pyproject.toml - this way providers are installed from PyPI.
   Feature request to handle it has been raised in the
   https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10991

2) The http provider was added to the constraint in PRs where
   the http provider is a required dependency (for example in
   discord provider). Since the http provider is not yet
   migrated, discord installation in workspace will pull it
   from PyPI rather than from the local workspace.

   This has been fixed by simply migrating the http provider
   to the new structure,

Apache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.
In case of doubts contact the developers at:
Mailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org
Slack: https://s.apache.org/airflow-slack

tiberio-baptista (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-27 13:25:07 UTC): That's a good question that I hadn't considered.

For compatibility's sake, we could remove `pod` from the callback method parameters, and `PodManager` will instead provide `pod` as part of `kwargs`, becoming an optional parameter.

I'll modify PR once I get back to my PC.

I have to say that from my point of view this is a bug fix not a feature. Given https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/43757
I think we should backport it to 2.10 - this is really something that causes pain for users on 2.10 (including myself)

shubhamraj-git (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-27 07:45:28 UTC): Sure, also we have to add tests regarding this. This PR don't do that.

shubhamraj-git (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-28 13:37:51 UTC): @jscheffl @pierrejeambrun Yes, I will be adding tests soon.
Will take care of backport PR, It's a separate fix altogether.

shubhamraj-git (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-29 03:21:30 UTC): This is just to prevent accidental merge till the tests are added, I will reopen in a while.

Tests are marked as xfail till then. we need to fix that post the fix for above issue gets merge.

potiuk on (2025-01-27 11:57:42 UTC): Yeah. That requires a bit of deeper look :). On it

potiuk on (2025-01-27 12:17:43 UTC): This has something to do with bad constraints generation (so an issue that I am already aware of):

Cyrrently the source constraints have this:

```
...
aliyun-python-sdk-kms==2.16.5
amqp==5.3.1
analytics-python==1.4.post1
annotated-types==0.7.0
ansicolors==1.1.8
anyio==4.8.0
apache-airflow-providers-http==5.0.0
apache-beam==2.62.0
apispec==6.8.1
apprise==1.9.2
...
```

So - for some reasons constraints generated in this build contain `apache-airflow-providers-http` where it should not. On it.

amoghrajesh on (2025-01-27 13:12:47 UTC): I thought breeze generated that (could be wrong), maybe some bug there?

potiuk on (2025-01-27 13:21:14 UTC): New structure of providers made a change how those are resolved an calculated (workspace feature is interfering with it) - I have a half-done fix already - PR will be there later today.

potiuk on (2025-01-27 13:21:58 UTC): We will have to overcome some `uv` limitations - so I have to implement some hacks and open a feature request for `uv` to handle some cases - so that we can remove the hack eventually. Stay tuned.

potiuk on (2025-01-27 16:42:54 UTC): https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/46139 should fix it - together with constraint generation

potiuk on (2025-01-27 19:01:12 UTC): Ok. you can rebase it @shubhamraj-git

You can attempt to backport this manually by running:

```bash
cherry_picker 7cc4202 v2-10-test
```

This should apply the commit to the v2-10-test branch and leave the commit in conflict state marking
the files that need manual conflict resolution.

After you have resolved the conflicts, you can continue the backport process by running:

```bash
cherry_picker --continue
```

tirkarthi (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-26 16:11:43 UTC): The API endpoint to fetch extra links doesn't accept `map_index` so I guess it's not yet supported and should probably be hidden for mapped tasks until implemented like legacy UI.

tirkarthi (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-29 02:35:37 UTC): Thanks @shubhamraj-git , I had a similar patch locally and I think the PR should work. I will wait for the changes to be merged to rebase here or take the frontend changes in a new PR after the PR.

pierrejeambrun on (2025-01-30 14:04:01 UTC): Is that working locally in breeze ? Are you using another executor because Task SDK does not support extra links so I expect errors there.

shubhamraj-git on (2025-01-30 14:13:42 UTC): @pierrejeambrun  Yaa possible, I think `--executor CeleryExecutor` will work.

tirkarthi (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-01 12:16:33 UTC): @pierrejeambrun I am using a virtual environment to pull from git and do `uv pip install .` with `airflow scheduler` and `airflow dag-processor` in different shells. I am using extra links as per the docs and using it on `BashOperator` from `from airflow.providers.standard.operators.bash import BashOperator` . So I guess I am not using the task sdk here.

https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/define-extra-link.html

potiuk on (2025-02-01 12:26:40 UTC): See https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/07_local_virtualenv.rst - when we explain how to work with the new virtualenv model where we have mutliple packages: `uv sync --all-extras` and `uv sync --extra celery` are your friends as they are using the `uv workspace` feature which installs all internal airflow packages as needed and all necessary dependencies for the provider extras you specify.

eladkal on (2025-02-04 11:41:30 UTC): Are we happy with having it in the details tab?
I have to say, I click on the details tab rarely (for the info that we are having there).
On the other hand, I really need the extra link when I view failure logs.

I am not UX expert but I think we need better place for the extra links than the details tab.

tirkarthi (Issue Creator) on (2025-02-04 11:57:28 UTC): In Airflow 2 usually clicking on the task instance in grid leads to the task instance details tab. In Airflow 3 logs are made as the default tab. I am fine with moving extra links there if okay.

eladkal on (2025-02-04 12:03:50 UTC): Getting to the extra links in 2.10 is very inconvenient to my taste.
I would rather the links to be folded/expanded above the logs/events/xcom tabs, but I leave this choice to the UX experts :)

Updates task state the Adds 2 missing states (""skipped"", ""deferred"") to the diagram, with more details on state transition conditions.

 - [Task Instance State Documentation (v2.10.4)](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.10.4/core-concepts/tasks.html#task-instances)

## Details
 - Adds missing states to the diagram (""skipped"" and ""deferred"")
 - Adds missing condition nodes to state transition
 - Adds ""trigger"" component (which handles deferred tasks) to the diagram
 - Coverts multiple conditional branch in the graph into sequence (multi-staged) of binary conditional branches
 - Split states into three categories: ""shared states"", ""states only for sensors"", and ""states only for deferrable tasks""
 - Uses different icons to differentiate task states and Airflow components
 - Uses `diagrams` library for automated plotting and pre-commit integration; rename ""task_lifecycle_diagram"" to ""diagram_task_lifecycle"" to comply with pre-commit condition

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contributors' Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/README.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (ruff, mypy and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/08_static_code_checks.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory). Adding a new operator? Check this short [guide](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/docs/apache-airflow/howto/custom-operator.rst) Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\n- Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/dev/breeze/doc/README.rst) for testing locally, it's a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\n- Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from Committers.\n- Please follow [ASF Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct) for all communication including (but not limited to) comments on Pull Requests, Mailing list and Slack.\n- Be sure to read the [Airflow Coding style]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#coding-style-and-best-practices).\n- Always keep your Pull Requests rebased, otherwise your build might fail due to changes not related to your commits.\nApache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀.\nIn case of doubts contact the developers at:\nMailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\nSlack: https://s.apache.org/airflow-slack"", 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 26, 9, 0, 35, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)}, {'comment_id': 2614288185, 'issue_id': 2811409101, 'author': 'eladkal', 'body': ""Nice.\r\nnote that task can start execution directly from triggerer without going to the worker first\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38674\r\n\r\nI do have some problem with just updating the image like that.

eladkal on (2025-01-26 09:12:59 UTC): Nice.
note that task can start execution directly from triggerer without going to the worker first
https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38674

I do have some problem with just updating the image like that. It doesn't offer the ability to make changes easily.
Ideally we should have a script that generate the image (diagram as code) similar to [how we generate the ERD diagram](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/3f6f04868d09a8766e4652417b7c0e8082ca2fd7/scripts/in_container/run_prepare_er_diagram.py) for the database.
we can use https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams

pykenny (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-27 07:49:25 UTC): The original diagram:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e36b3b30-7278-4a01-9860-dd1ff5b979ae)

Diagram after adding triggerer tasks:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b683cdd4-a695-4c9a-adc2-993a6cc6b1aa)

**Question: Does a triggerer task enter ""queued"" state during its lifecycle, or it's directly passed to the triggerer once it gets into ""scheduled"" state?**

potiuk on (2025-01-27 09:29:44 UTC): Is there a way we can easily get to update that picture when it changes in the future ? 

I am a big fan of generating such images from text / code rather than drawing them by hand. We even already have a number of such images generated from the code via pre-commit - using the cool `diagrams` library:

Python file: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/docs/apache-airflow/img/diagram_basic_airflow_architecture.py
Resulting diagram: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/docs/apache-airflow/img/diagram_basic_airflow_architecture.png

And it's enough to re-run the python file to get the new diagram generated based on it.

I somehow don't see a viable path how we can - in the future - easily modify such state diagram if all we have is the .png file or if we need some external tool (what?) to modify the diagram.

Yes it might maybe look nicer when generated by hand, but for me long-term maintainabilty is far more important. Otherwise we will have exactly the same situation that we already experienced - where outdated pictures were basically ""lying"" to our users about someething - where they were supposed to reflect the reality. This is pretty much inevitable, if we have no easy way to regenerate the images with updated changes - and where drawing those by-hand is not really an option.

WDYT @pykenny ? Maybe you should try to replicate the diagram using similar approach as our architecture diagrams?

pykenny (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-27 15:27:16 UTC): Got your point, I see how the project change its way to manage graphs since last year. That will just take longer to complete in my out-of-date dev environment, however (just realized PyCharm Community haven't had uv integration yet, [at least not in their stable versions](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-70533/Support-package-management-via-uv)).

**(Update)** PyCharm starts supporting uv environment from [2024.3.2](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/whatsnew/2024-3-2/) release.

potiuk on (2025-01-27 22:13:44 UTC): `uv sync` -> creates .venv that you can add as existing virtual environment. That's all you need.

pykenny (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-28 03:31:36 UTC): I know it better goes into discussion... but `diagrams` is not included in the installed dependencies (if `uv sync --all-extras --all-groups` installs all dependencies possible, and of course I can't do `uv pip install diagrams` to get a makeshift patch now), and `pre-commit` install extra dependencies in their cache, instead of virtual environment uv's using. Is that designed so on purpose?

**(Update)** ~~Oh. So is that the cause?~~


**(Update)** From uv lockfile, seems that it blocks installing `diagrams` on MacOS, perhaps because of requirement on Graphviz installation:
```
    { name = ""diagrams"", marker = ""sys_platform != 'darwin'"" },
```

**(Update)** As the result, turned to using [pip install approach](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/699171a6d455cfd66ecc81fd5638129d06317826/contributing-docs/07_local_virtualenv.rst#creating-and-installing-airflow-with-other-build-frontends) as fallback, then `pip install diagrams` to add the package into environment (and of course, Graphviz is already installed on the machine).

potiuk on (2025-01-29 23:36:20 UTC): Yep. that's likely.

pykenny (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-30 09:21:50 UTC): Okay, here's the new one with `diagrams` library:

- [x] Implementation
- [x] E2E Test
- [x] Unit Test

## What does this PR do?
- Fix the error on the XCom filter page in the UI, which is preventing users from using values as filter conditions to select the XCom records they want.

## Change details
- `airflow/www/utils.py`:
    - Add `XComFilterStartsWith`, `XComFilterEndsWith`, `XComFilterEqual`, `XComFilterContains`, `XComFilterNotStartsWith`, `XComFilterNotEndsWith`, `XComFilterNotContains`, and `XComFilterNotEqual` classes to handle different types of filtering for XCom values.
        - Since the `value` is stored in the `xcom` table in PostgreSQL's `bytea` format, we first need to convert it into a UTF-8 string. Additionally, because the value content is enclosed in double quotes before being encoded as `bytea` and stored in the database, we also need to remove the leading and trailing double quotes from the UTF-8 formatted value in order to compare it with the user's input filter condition.
            - describe `xcom` table:

    - Updated the `AirflowFilterConverter` class to include the new XCom filters in its conversion table.
    - Add the `is_xcom_value` method to check if a column name corresponds to an XCom value.
- `tests/www/test_utils.py`:
    - Add a unit test case `TestXComFilter` to test whether the SQLAlchemy call sequence behaves as expected.

## How did you test?
- Unit Test in `tests/www/test_utils.py`
- E2E Test
    - I used the [example code provided by Airflow](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-passing-data-between-tasks/#example-dag-using-xcoms) to push the XCom content to the database during DAG execution, and then I operated the XCom filter on the Web UI.

I apologize. I am the new contributor to this project. Over the past few days, I had an offline handover with @josix  regarding this issue, and I will be responsible moving forward. However, while preparing the PR, I accidentally clicked on ""create PR."" I’m sorry for the disruption. Once the PR is ready, I will re-open it for your review. 🙏🏽

josix on (2025-01-26 07:27:01 UTC): Hi @eladkal, sorry to bother you. I’m trying to have @wei-juncheng take over the testing part for #45679 as his first contribution to Airflow. Since he’s new to OSS contributions, his profile doesn’t have many contribution records yet.

@wei-juncheng could you help add more information about what the PR has made and also correct the status to Draft if it is not ready, I'll also close my original PR to avoid confusion, thanks!

Lee-W on (2025-01-26 07:52:13 UTC): Hi @eladkal, 

Thank you for working on filtering potential AI spam. 😊 

I wanted to give you a quick heads-up. I know @josix personally, and he has already created a few pull requests (PRs) and even presented them at the Airflow Town Hall. Additionally, @wei-juncheng is a local community member from Taiwan who is interested in contributing to Airflow and has just started his journey in OSS contributions. I've asked @wei-juncheng to create another PR with more details so he can continue working on this issue and avoid making his PR look like spam. Sorry for the disruption. 🙏

eladkal on (2025-01-26 07:53:59 UTC): Ah cool :)

Lee-W on (2025-01-26 07:54:35 UTC): ah... yes, we can just reopen it haha. Thanks so much for helping out!

boring-cyborg[bot] on (2025-02-07 02:28:31 UTC): Awesome work, congrats on your first merged pull request! You are invited to check our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues) for additional contributions.

2811116818,pull_request,closed,,Add create XCom endpoint in RestAPI,"related: #45966 


Update: Modifying the description only for create API and simplifying use case.

The XCom creation API fills a critical gap by enabling dynamic updates to workflows.
Current XComs are tied to task execution, limiting flexibility for long-running workflows.
The API allows dynamic creation of XCom values during execution, This is needed mostly for the use case of fixing manually recover from problems with workflows.
Avoid placeholder tasks just to generate XComs.

We will also have the edit XCom API as part of #45966 coming soon. This PR is only for creation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Steps to play around the feature.

1. Add the following Dag.

_This Airflow DAG demonstrates how to use XComs for passing data between tasks. The first task (wait_and_not_push) waits for 1 minute but does not push any XCom. The second task (pull_and_print) attempts to pull an XCom value with the key outbound_key1 from the first task, logs it if found, or warns if absent._

```
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.standard.operators.python import PythonOperator
import time
import logging
import pendulum

# Default arguments for the DAG
default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'retries': 1
}

# Initialize the DAG
with DAG(
    dag_id=""xcom_pull_example_dag"",
    default_args=default_args,
    description=""A DAG demonstrating XCom pull with key 'outbound_key1'"",
    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2025, 1, 1, tz=""UTC""),
    catchup=False,
    tags=[""xcom"", ""example""],
) as dag:

    def wait_and_not_push_xcom(**kwargs):
        """"""
        Task to wait for 1 minute.
        """"""
        logging.info(""Waiting for 1 minute..."")
        time.sleep(60)  # Wait for 1 minute

    def pull_and_print_xcom(**kwargs):
        """"""
        Task to pull an XCom entry with key 'outbound_key1' and print its value.
        """"""
        ti = kwargs[""ti""]
        xcom_value = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids=""wait_and_not_push"", key=""outbound_key1"")

        if xcom_value:
            logging.info(f""Retrieved XCom value for key 'outbound_key1': {xcom_value}"")
        else:
            logging.warning(""No XCom value found for key 'outbound_key1'!"")

    # First task: Wait for 1 minute
    wait_and_not_push = PythonOperator(
        task_id=""wait_and_not_push"",
        python_callable=wait_and_not_push_xcom
    )

    # Second task: Pull the XCom entry and print its value
    pull_and_print = PythonOperator(
        task_id=""pull_and_print"",
        python_callable=pull_and_print_xcom
    )

    # Define the task dependencies
    wait_and_not_push >> pull_and_print

```

3. Trigger the run.
4. As soon as the run starts, trigger an XCom creation through API (Can do it from swagger: http://localhost:29091/docs#/XCom/create_xcom_entry)

<img width=""746"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7f38435-c0d8-4586-ba71-d3c61b6ad584"" />

Now, check the logs, You can see the **XCom pull was successful**.

I don't know if there is a specific design pattern that need to be considered. Just my thought.

I would understand if the API can be used to ""patch"" wrong/incorrect XCom values administratively for specific szenarios where upstream tasks can not be re-executed but values are incorrect. But the PR of this API is only adding XCom, will raise an error  if the value is existing.

So before merging I'd propose to have a bit of discussion between the other maintainers if we want to open XCom up to external applications to signal a processing status.

If so then this integration pattern would require a bit of documentation as well.

This is not the use case. The use case is incident recovery. When on call fixes problems with data pipeline manual interventions sometimes required.

2811038264,pull_request,closed,,Fixes issue #45966,"This pull request introduces the following updates to the `XCom` and `XComEntry `components, improving the functionality and user experience when viewing XCom entries within a DAG run:

### Changes Made:
1.` XComEntry.tsx:`

- Error Handling: Added error handling to display error messages when the XCom value fetch fails.
- Clipboard Copy Feedback: Implemented a toast notification that alerts the user when an XCom value has been successfully copied to the clipboard.
- Loading Skeleton: Added a loading skeleton that appears while the XCom value is being fetched.
- Fallback for Missing Data: Displayed a fallback message (""No XCom data available"") when no value is present for a given XCom entry.

2. `XCom.tsx:`

- Pagination Handling: Integrated pagination functionality to fetch and display paginated XCom entries for the selected DAG run and task.
- Error Alert: Added an `ErrorAlert `component to handle and display any errors that occur during the XCom entries fetch.
- Table State Management: Enhanced the state management of the table (pagination, sorting) via `useTableURLState`, ensuring consistency when navigating between pages.
- `DataTable` Integration: Updated the `DataTable` component to display XCom entries with appropriate loading and pagination states.

### Why this is needed:
