2449623674,pull_request,closed,,Fix check served logs logic,"**Background:**

In #31101, I added logic to check for served logs when we did not find either local or remote logs.

In #32561, contributor @khrol observed that for a task with multiple tries, if the user was looking at the logs for a non-running try, the UI would show an erroneous and potentially confusing 404 error.  @khrol attempted a fix that would suppress this error message.

In #39177, contributor @kahlstrm reported a bug introduced by #32562 and attempted to fix it.

The bug was reportedly that “non-running task try logs weren’t shown in the UI for running tasks”.  This I think refers to when you are looking at the logs for a failed attempt. The contributor added, “This is due to us storing the logs on the worker with a Persistent Volume”.  I assume this means that we did not check served logs in that case.

One question: why couldn’t the webserver access the PV?  In #39496 same user added more conditions.

**Problem:** 

We can't see logs served from triggerer when task deferred.

**This PR:**

This PR essentially restores the behavior to what it was prior to #32561.  So we undo the enhancement in #32561, the first attempted fix #39177, and the second attempted fix #39496.

This means that while a task is in running state, if you look at logs for prior failed attempts, you may see a ""checked served logs and did not find any"" message.  This can be mildly confusing but it's more important to restore access to logs.

-->
When DefaultExtractor is used, so the operator has OpenLineage methods implemented (at least one of: on_start, on_complete) we are logging a WARNING each time there is no on_start method. This happens because we are validating OL metadata returned by extractor, [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/d6bc1f69a36dd0ee08f02fb6e6f0388342f5fb1b/airflow/providers/openlineage/extractors/manager.py#L105). This validation makes sense and we should keep it, but imho the default extractor should return empty data when there is no on_start method defined, because it means that the on_complete method will be called. 

There is no need to return None ourselves and then log a warning because we found a None 😄 

Some logs of current behaviour:
```
[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {listener.py:383} DEBUG - Executing OpenLineage process - on_running - pid 376
[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {manager.py:149} DEBUG - extractor for CustomOperator is <class 'airflow.providers.openlineage.extractors.base.DefaultExtractor'>
[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {manager.py:98} DEBUG - Using extractor DefaultExtractor task_type=CustomOperator airflow_dag_id=dag task_id=task airflow_run_id=manual__2024-08-05T15:04:29.761674+00:00 
[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {base.py:101} DEBUG - Trying to execute `get_openlineage_facets_on_start` for CustomOperator.
[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {base.py:112} DEBUG - Operator CustomOperator does not have the get_openlineage_facets_on_start method.
[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {manager.py:104} DEBUG - Found task metadata for operation task: None
[2024-08-05, 15:04:30 UTC] {manager.py:267} WARNING - Extractor returns non-valid metadata: None
```

After the change, we would get rid of this warning. We would still get the information that there is no on_start method and metadata found would be `OperatorLineage()`

2448307647,pull_request,closed,,Add DatasetDagRunQueue to all the consuming DAGs of a dataset alias,"## Why
Ever since https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40693, we have been able to schedule a DAG based on DatasetAlias. When a dataset alias is resolved in a producer DAG for the first time, a consumer DAG that depends on that dataset alias will have to wait for the next round of DAG parsing to realize its dependency on the resolved datasets. Consequently, the consumer DAG will need to wait for the second run of the producer DAG to be triggered.

## What
This PR created DDRQ for the consuming dags of dataset alias as well. So after the consumer DAG is updated after DAG parsing, it will have DDRQ which might triggers it.

2447940866,pull_request,closed,,Swallow exception when mini-scheduling raises an exception,"When mini-scheduler raises an exception, it has a bit weird side effect - the task succeeds but it is seen as failed and scheduler gets confused. Also flower celery worker in this case shows an error.

This happens for example when DAG contains non-serializable tasks.

This PR swallows any exceptions raised in mini-scheduler and simply logs them as error rather than fail the process. Mini-scheduler is generally optional and we are also already sometimes skipping it already so occasional skipping is not a big problem.

The problem might be related to when there is no `state` in `spark_job_info` since the pod is deleted manually or externally from the Kubernetes environment, the default always went into SUBMITTED even though the keys don't exist in the spark_job_info.
I still haven't fully tested yet if it solves the issue. I will test and make the MR ready.

I tried to make them working but also if the internal API server is started in pytest, a DB access is needed which heavily conflicts with the traceback session mode.

### Apache Airflow version

Other Airflow 2 version (please specify below)

### If ""Other Airflow 2 version"" selected, which one?

2.7.2

### What happened?

The trigger instance handled by triggerer-2 was canceled due to reassignment to triggerer-1.
As a result, triggerer-2 cleaned up the local trigger instance, which terminated the remote job using its ID.
The trigger instance in triggerer-2 keep polling the status of remote job with the same id, but detected that the remote job was killed, so completed its run, and exited.
Consequently, the remote job failed due to the reassignment.

### What you think should happen instead?

Triggers will be canceled and cleaned up by the current triggerer process if the current triggerer finds that those running trigger instances have been reassigned to other triggerers.
However, if the cleanup is called prematurely while the trigger is still in an active state, it could impact the same trigger when reassigned to another triggerer process.
Therefore, introducing the capability to disable this cleanup behavior in such scenarios.

### How to reproduce

1. Set the triggerer_health_check_threshold to a small number like 3(s).
2. Make triggerer instances at least 2.
3. Use blocking io like http request in the trigger's run method.
4. Trigger multiple deferred tasks(for our cases: 100+ trigger jobs) in the same time.

TakawaAkirayo (Issue Creator) on (2024-08-05 04:30:04 UTC): CC @potiuk If there are any other suggested solutions for this, our use case is as follows:

1.Submit a job to Apache Kyuubi in the worker, which will return a remote job ID and the remote job executed in Kyuubi side.
2.Defer the task by creating a trigger and pass the remote job ID to the trigger.
3.The trigger will continuously check the status of the remote job in the run method and yield an event once the job succeeds or fails.
4.In the trigger's cleanup method, we terminate the remote job if the remote job ID exists.

The problem is that the cleanup method could called when a task is canceled or the trigger is reassigned to another triggerer. The issue arises when the cleanup method is called during reassignment, which terminates the remote job. As a result, once reassigned to another triggerer, the remote job fails.

To avoid making the trigger heavier, we chose not to move step 1 (submitting the job and receiving the remote job ID) into the trigger's run method. This decision is based on the need to handle many preparations, such as authentication setup and local file propagation, which could burden the trigger process.

2445076621,pull_request,closed,,kubernetes executor cleanup_stuck_queued_tasks optimization,"Problem: Airflow running the cleanup_stuck_queued_tasks function on a certain frequency. When we run the airflow on a large Kube cluster (pods more than > 5K). Internally the cleanup_stuck_queued_tasks function loops through each queued task (when they breach task queued timeout) and checks the corresponding worker pod existence in the Kube cluster. Right now, this existence check using list pods Kube API. The API is taking more than 1s. if there are 120 queued tasks, then it will take ~ 120 seconds (1s * 120). So, this leads the scheduler to spend most of its time in this function rather than scheduling the tasks. It leads to none of the jobs being scheduled or degraded scheduler performance.

Solution: Use single k8 list pods batch api call to get all the worker pod owned by scheduler. Prepare the set of searchable strings using pod annotations. Use this set data structure and identify whether the task associated pod exists or not. This reduces the number kube api sever calls significantly. 

set elements string format:
(dag_id=<dag_id>,task_id=<task_id>,[,map_index=<map_index>],[run_id=<run_id>]

## Problem
Whenever we are trying to debug issues related to OpenLineage coming from users, we usually require information about versions of other providers used in the process, for reproducing purposes. It would be great to have that information in the events already to reduce the time and effort needed for debugging, but only when some flag is turned on explicitly on the user side (f.e. airflow log level is set to debug). This PR adds a DebugRun facet to Airflow, that contains information about all packages and their versions. In the future, we could possibly extend that facet with other useful information.

### Questions:

- I'm not sure, if we should add this facet to all events (current implementation), or only add it to some specific events (which?).
- Can we rely on the Airflow logging level when deciding whether or not to attach this facet? I wanted to avoid creating another flag, that would basically had to be set together with DEBUG logging level. (Whenever debugging user issues, we are asking for debug logs anyway)


## Background:
Initially, I aimed to include package information in the producer field for specific facets but wanted to keep it hassle-free for both users and developers. I created some POC for each solution, but this debug facet seems the best for now.

We could automatically track where a facet is created and assign the producer, but the complexity and maintenance effort are not worth it for such a simple feature.

I also considered resetting the producer for facets after creation using a decorator or function in common.compat provider, but this would require additional code from developers when adding OL support for operators. With hook level lineage coming, it could become even more complex. This is something we might revisit in the future, as having the producer field identify the actual provider of the facet at all times is beneficial (regardless of OL configuration, logging level, etc.).

For now, the simple debug facet should suffice.

Please let me know your thoughts.

I’m not sure I understand this fully. Are you concerned that this debug facet might consume too many resources and thereby affect the system’s performance? If you could explain your concerns in more detail, I can address them more effectively.

potiuk on (2024-08-05 11:46:09 UTC): Yeah. No strong concerns here -> just wondered how much extra overhead it will add to retrieve that information - generally speaking the problem with such debugging information is that it might change the behaviour of the system (like adding or avoiding race conditions - introducing things call ""heisenbugs"" - the more you look at the problem, the less likely it is to occur. So generrally speaking - as low overhead as possible in this kind of debugging facility - the better.

In this sense - connecting it to airflow ""debug"" log level is not necessarily a good idea - because Airflow in debug log generates a loooooot of debugging information and this **might** impact how airflow behaves. 

So my concern here is to:

a) limit the overhead when it is enabled (this can be done as well by caching the information - so maybe that will be enough to cache the facet. JUST retrieving all installed package information is pretty heavy, and we should do it once per interpreter run ideally.

b) I **think** there should be a way to enable this logging independently from Airflow logs, because it might well be that just enabling debug logs will have other side effects.

Now, it should run only once in the scheduler and once per task on the worker, but only when the `debug_mode` flag is explicitly enabled by the user. I also updated the documentation to inform users about the useful information they can provide to us when debugging.

2443953606,pull_request,closed,,Fix RedshiftDataOperator not running in deferred mode when it should,"# Problems
- When a `RedshiftDataOperator` task is configured with `deferrable=True` and `wait_for_completion=True` (the default), it doesn't go in `deferred` state. Instead it stays in `running` state until the statement completes.
- Also, if `wait_for_completion=False` and `deferrable=True`, after the statement is submitted, the task will still go into `deferred` mode and wait for the statement to complete.

# Reasons
- Currently, if `deferrable=True`, `self.wait_for_completion` is set to `False` in `execute()`, but never used after.
- `execute` does not check whether the task should wait for completion, only if it should be deferred.

# Solution
- Overwrite `wait_for_completion` instead of `self.wait_for_completion` when deferrable. Also, remove redundant condition on `self.wait_for_completion`
- Before going into deferrable mode, also check that the task is supposed to wait for completion.

# How I tested
Checked with this simple DAG that the operator now behaves as expected, for all 4 combinations:
```python
from airflow.decorators import dag
from airflow.providers.amazon.aws.operators.redshift_data import RedshiftDataOperator

@dag(
    ""Foo"",
)
def _():
    for task_id, config in {
        ""wait_defer"": {""deferrable"": True, ""wait_for_completion"": True},
        ""wait_no_defer"": {""deferrable"": False, ""wait_for_completion"": True},
        ""no_wait_defer"": {""deferrable"": True, ""wait_for_completion"": False},
        ""no_wait_no_defer"": {""deferrable"": False, ""wait_for_completion"": False},
    }.items():
        RedshiftDataOperator(
            task_id=task_id,
            aws_conn_id=""redshift_data"",
            cluster_identifier=""data-warehouse"",

            SELECT *

            LIMIT 10;"""""",
            deferrable=config[""deferrable""],
            wait_for_completion=config[""wait_for_completion""],
        )

If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our Contributors' Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/README.rst)\nHere are some useful points:\n- Pay attention to the quality of your code (ruff, mypy and type annotations). Our [pre-commits]( https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/08_static_code_checks.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks) will help you with that.\n- In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).

eladkal on (2024-08-02 08:15:04 UTC): Ah OK.
Can you please add unit test to avoid regression?

borismo (Issue Creator) on (2024-08-03 09:08:11 UTC): Here's what I did:
- tweaked the existing `deferrable_operator` fixture so it waits for completion. The `test_execute_defer` test was failing with my fix. I think this test should use an operator configured to wait.
- added a test which verifies that if we don't want to wait for completion, the operator should not check whether the statement has completed and also shouldn't enter deferred mode.

Not sure if it's a good idea to iterate over `deferrable`. I did so to keep it DRY, since if separate, the 2 two tests would be almost identical. And I intend the test to really emphasize on the fact that the `deferrable` value doesn't matter.

We noticed that time zone from config (""default_timezone = Europe/Moscow"") is not taken into account when generating ""run_id"". 
Also ""execution_date"" field is always shown in UTC in Airflow UI, see my screenshots.

I created this patch to generate ""run_id"" and to display ""execution_date"" in specified default time zone (get ""default_timezone"" option from configuration). 
Moreover I call ""coerce_datetime()"" function in api, thus links to task instances will have ""execution_date"" parameter with correct time zone in UI.

When multiple operators have the same name (like AzureBlobStorageToGCSOperator), we can unintentionally overwrite the OL supported operator with OL unsupported one, as we used class name when building class registry. This PR changes that to use full import path, it should fix the problem.

2441882580,pull_request,closed,,fix: Fixing Helm chart flower ingress service reference,"closes #41175

### What happened

We are sub charting the official airflow chart and for this reason we need to use `fullnameOverride: ""airflow""` settings to achieve the desired k8s resource names. However when we are using it the flower ingress becomes invalid because it want's to connect to non existing service name. Root cause are in the ingress.yaml. The webserver ingress can handle it with no problem.

Incorrect code section

`flower-ingress.yaml` - [code section](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/daccc75b064c735636027b20f3edb82da69ffab1/chart/templates/flower/flower-ingress.yaml#L75)
```yaml
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              service:
                name: {{ $.Release.Name }}-flower
                port:
                  name: flower-ui
```

While in the correct code section

`webserver-ingress.yaml` - [code section](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/daccc75b064c735636027b20f3edb82da69ffab1/chart/templates/webserver/webserver-ingress.yaml#L83)

```yaml
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              service:
                name: {{ $fullname }}-webserver
                port:
                  name: airflow-ui
```


To overcome this issue we need to run this command on every deployment
```bash
kubectl patch ingress airflow-flower-ingress \
    --namespace ""airflow"" \
    --type='json' \
    -p='[{""op"": ""replace"", ""path"": ""/spec/rules/0/http/paths/0/backend/service/name"", ""value"":""airflow-flower""}]'
```

### What you think should happen instead

The following code should be updated to match how webserver ingress works
`flower-ingress.yaml` - [code section](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/daccc75b064c735636027b20f3edb82da69ffab1/chart/templates/flower/flower-ingress.yaml#L75)
```yaml
spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              service:
                name: {{ $fullname }}-flower
                port:
                  name: flower-ui
```

I'm happy to add helm test for the modified ingress object, however the helm test framework is fully missing from the helm chart and we need to add the automated test runs to the CI/CD pipelines as well.

Sorry for the late reply I was on extended vacation.

I have run into to a problem when I added the `""fullnameOverride"": ""test-basic""` it looks like the `chart/templates/_helpers.yaml` is not executed when I run the tests.

Here are my tests

            values={""ingress"": {""web"": {""enabled"": True}}},
            show_only=[""templates/webserver/webserver-ingress.yaml""],
        )

        assert ""release-name-webserver"" == jmespath.search(""spec.rules[0].http.paths[0].backend.service.name"", docs[0])

    def test_backend_service_name_with_fullname_override(self):
        docs = render_chart(
            values={""fullnameOverride"": ""test-basic"",
                    ""ingress"": {""web"": {""enabled"": True}}},
            show_only=[""templates/webserver/webserver-ingress.yaml""],

        )

        assert ""test-basic-webserver"" == jmespath.search(""spec.rules[0].http.paths[0].backend.service.name"", docs[0])
```


`helm_tests/webserver/test_ingress_flower.py`

```python
    def test_backend_service_name(self):
        docs = render_chart(
            values={""ingress"": {""enabled"": True}, ""flower"": {""enabled"": True}},
            show_only=[""templates/flower/flower-ingress.yaml""],
        )

        assert ""release-name-flower"" == jmespath.search(""spec.rules[0].http.paths[0].backend.service.name"", docs[0])

    def test_backend_service_name_with_fullname_override(self):

andormarkus (Issue Creator) on (2024-09-13 21:23:24 UTC): Hi @romsharon98

Thank you so much the help. Now my tests are passing.
Please let me know If I need to more test of where to adjust the code?

Thanks,
Andor

romsharon98 on (2024-09-14 03:25:23 UTC): You have static checks fail.
Better work with pre commit to see those errors before you commit.

You can see how to install it here

andormarkus (Issue Creator) on (2024-09-14 21:42:01 UTC): Hi @romsharon98
All checks are now passing.

Thanks,

2441866433,pull_request,closed,,Pass content of kube/config file to triggerer as a dictionary,"The idea of passing content of .kube/config file as a dictionary to Triggerer was introduced with the first implementation of deferrable mode in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/29017.
Later, due to security concerns related to storing the config file in trigger table this change was reverted.
With the following change https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38233 that concern has been mitigated and the change (of passing config as a map to the trigger) can be reapplied.

`polars` has an advantage over `pandas` when dealing with large amounts of data.
Serializing `polars` can be supported in much the same way as `pandas`. 

However, rather than supporting `polars` objects, it may be better to convert them to `pandas` objects.
A `polars` can be converted to a zero-copy `pandas` frame in the following way
```python
pd_frame = frame.to_pandas(use_pyarrow_extension_array=True)
```
(but, I have not verified that deserializing to a `pandas` object and then converting to a `polars` object is efficient.)

- Printing logs in a trigger does not add much value to the DAG author since logs go to the triggerer and not task logs
- The trigger `SageMakerTrainingPrintLogTrigger` contains some bugs since the operator `SageMakerTrainingOperator` does not work when created with `deferrable=True` and `print_log=True`. The trigger wait indefinitely for the job to complete
- Having two different triggers to achieve the same thing with the only difference one is pushing more logs than the other does not make a lot of sense

These tests expect deprecation warning which happens on the internal API side in DB isolation mode. No need to test that in DB isolation mode.

2439937935,pull_request,closed,,Make task.run work with DB isolation,"This PR adds possibility to handle tests that perform task.run call in DB isolation mode. This call is treated specially - i.e. it will be possible for the run() method to use the DB directly. to set up the task but then when _run_raw_task below will use the DB, there will be an error raised.

That allows to fix the `test_core.py` and likely a number of other tests that rely on the run() method to run the tests.

This required to improve the _set_ti_attrs method to handle dag_run inside the task instance pydantic to task instance mapping - because we are actually using TaskInstance for those tests not TaskInstancePydantic under the hood.

Currently the link to Dataproc Serverless Batch is only available after its successful execution.
To improve user experience publish a link right after the batch starts execution if `batch_id` was provided. It makes it easier to observe the progress and find batch logs when it fails.
The only drawback is that if batch creation fails before it starts execution, the link will point to nowhere, but I think it is acceptable considering the gains.

The main bug here was that the hook parameters were not properly given to the SnowflakeSqlAPIHook and then they were not properly assigned. The query execution method of the hook statically assigned configuration from Airflow connection. In this PR it is changed so that:
1. hook_params from SnowflakeSqlApiOperator object is passed into the hook object through unpacking the variable.
2. In SnowflakeSqlApiHook, for each of the parameter (database, role, schema, warehouse) there is a check performed for whether they were provided in the parameters (in their parent class SnowflakeHook, they are initialized to None, hence the if self.database|schema|role|warehouse) and if not, they are taken from connection definition.

2439648787,pull_request,closed,,Bugfix query count statistics when parsing DAG file,"This PR fixes a bug in counting queries during a DAG file parsing (the feature was implemented in #40323).

A context manager `count_queries` was implemented previously, and it is responsible for counting queries within its scope. The reason why it was missing some queries and misreporting statistics is that its scope wasn't covering all steps of parsing the DAG file. This PR moves a `count_queries` invocation higher to the level of `DagFileProcessor.process_file()` method, which ensures that all the queries are counted.

The issue mentions that fields backed by the BS3TextFieldWidget cannot be deleted once populated. To delete those fields, the user must delete the connection and create a new one. The ""Changed Row"" message displayed after a row is edited is misleading. 

Therefore, as a temporary fix, I have created a warning that always shows when the user is editing a connection form as shown below.

What I tried to do was get the specific fields that were populated and issue a warning with those field names when the user tries to delete them. However, I'm having trouble figuring out how to do that check when the user clicks the 'Save' button. So, I have a warning of the currently populated fields that can be modified but not deleted after the user clicks 'Save' shown below.

In either case, the log messsages are presented as a list

The bash and docker operators, among others, can export logs into XCOM to provide some feedback about the outcome of the command in the results. The AzureContainerInstancesOperator just detects if the container exits cleanly and exits with either 0 (success) or 1 (failure). This commit adds the ability to put either the last log message or all log messages into XCOM under the key 'logs' so it can be used in future operators to decide if it the operation within the container failed or succeeded.",perry2of5,2024-07-30 22:55:42+00:00,[],2024-10-09 16:12:29+00:00,2024-08-14 10:46:07+00:00,https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41142,"[('provider:microsoft-azure', 'Azure-related issues'), ('area:providers', '')]","[{'comment_id': 2259336139, 'issue_id': 2438803167, 'author': 'boring-cyborg[bot]', 'body': ""Congratulations on your first Pull Request and welcome to the Apache Airflow community!

potiuk on (2024-08-14 10:46:54 UTC): airflow/providers/fab/auth_manager/cli_commands/user_command.py

It was likely due to not rebased/rebuilt image with latest changes. Main succeeded, so all looks good.

perry2of5 (Issue Creator) on (2024-08-14 16:04:01 UTC): Thank you, @potiuk!

perry2of5 (Issue Creator) on (2024-08-14 20:30:14 UTC): I get the static-checks issue with a fresh checkout of main from the official repo. Is this likely to be a problem on my breeze install? An issue with the breeze config checked into the project? or an actual issue on main? I'm assuming it is one of the first two.

potiuk on (2024-08-14 20:38:31 UTC): no idea. Generally the system is designed to be consistent when you a) rebase, b) build the image when asked . This is what CI check does a) checks out the latest version b) builds the latest image c) uses the latest image to run the tests. If any of the steps are missing or delayed, the end results might differ. So if you are in doubt - ABR - Always Be Rebased.

1) rebased
2) breeze ci-image build 
3) run your tests

That should yield same results as CI build - but of course there are race conditions - someone could have pushed another change between the steps manually run. So again - if in doubt

1) rebase
2) build image
3) run your tests


Airflow has high traffic, things are chaning on hourly base ... so rebase, rebuild test is a recommended way.

roman-doubrava on (2024-10-09 12:10:57 UTC): @perry2of5 & @potiuk would it be possible to additionally enhace the AzureContainerInstancesOperator with the :param do_xcom_push: If True, the content of the file /airflow/xcom/return.json in the container will also be pushed to an XCom when the container completes, which would be similar behavior to the KubernetesPODOperator ?

perry2of5 (Issue Creator) on (2024-10-09 16:12:27 UTC): That seems possible. I'm not sure if it is an optimal idea. Perhaps it would be better to push the file into some sort of store and return the location in a message and retrieve it that way? If you open an issue then you could get feedback on the idea.
