2830505606,issue,open,,MySQL connections fail due to SQLite specific config in DbConfig,"I have set up a MySQL database using `systemctl start mysql` and it all works. The host and port are ""localhost"" and 3306 respectively with username ""root"".

I have filled these credentials in the `config.py` file as well and changed the `engine` parameter to `mysql`. 

Firstly I think the docstring for those functions are not updated because it calls for renaming of variables that are no longer present, but from what I figured the `name` under the `DbConfig` class refers to the database name.

Given all these, I am still unable to connect to the server. The following seem to be the issue:

1. The create_engine() command is not working because the interpreter never crosses that line of code (found through debug statements).
2. The database name passed to the mysql server is `.data/nettacker.db` which is invalid for MySQL databases and only works for SQLite. So the command CREATE DATABASE path/to/.data/nettacker.db gives an error.

The default config for DbConfig class is sqlite and that requires the nettacker.db file which is why the product works if no one tries to change the DbConfig.

Proposed solution:

1. Update the docstring for the DbConfig class
2. Use pymysql as a bridge to allow direct SQL connections and queries in the `mysql.py` file
3. Update the `db.py` file to allow both MySQL and SQLite
4. Increase the max connections for the server (user/admin has to do this)

I have tried these locally and they seem to work well. Let me know if you want me to push these changes for you to review.

Phantomwise on (2024-10-26 17:13:04 UTC): Ok, I thought I could do just the translation part, but if it requires testing I'll have to pass, I'm not qualified for that sadly. I'm not a developer, just looking for translation requests.

arkid15r on (2024-10-26 17:37:56 UTC): All you need to do is just make sure the app works after your changes. If that's out of your knowledge/qualification -- just go ahead and translate it similar to how it's done in #934 (no test added in that PR). The CI/CD will take care of that.

Thank you for the contribution!

bhagyashree980 on (2024-12-19 13:57:08 UTC): Hi @arkid15r @securestep9 ,
I noticed the request for contributors to translate scan-comparison-related messages into various languages. While Hindi is my native language, I would also love to contribute to translations in Bengali, as I have a good understanding of it.
If given the opportunity, I will ensure the translations are accurate and culturally appropriate. Please let me know if I can proceed or if there are specific guidelines I should follow.
Looking forward to your response!

arkid15r on (2024-12-22 20:37:41 UTC): Yes please go ahead. That'd be good l10n contribution!

Thank you!

osamaahmed17 on (2025-01-12 04:16:58 UTC): @arkid15r, I am a native Urdu speaker. Can I add my part for this issue?

arkid15r on (2025-01-12 05:07:53 UTC): Sure you can @osamaahmed17. Thank you!

Soumyaditya25 on (2025-01-28 13:23:57 UTC): Hi @arkid15r and @securestep9,  

I noticed the request for contributors to translate scan-comparison-related messages into various languages. I would love to contribute by translating them into Korean. While Korean is not my native language, I have learned it and have a strong understanding of it. Please let me know if I should proceed with this.  

Looking forward to your response!

securestep9 (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-29 13:04:01 UTC): @Soumyaditya25 if you are confident you can correctly translate to Korean then you are very welcome to contribute!

osamaahmed17 on (2025-02-06 00:39:43 UTC): @arkid15r I raised a PR for the Urdu translation (#994).

2165100555,issue,open,,Same 3 Ports and Never ANY Results,"Maybe it's because I'm new to bug bounty hunting/pentesting, but no matter what I do, I seem to get the same ports scanned with no results to show in the report.

subdomain_scan
subdomain_takeover_vuln
admin_scan

What am I missing or doing wrong? How do I use this tool correctly, or is it currently just broken? 

Because after completing the scan shown in the photograph, the report showed nothing of value (to my knowledge anyway) and almost no information altogether.

After that it loads your selected module and try to scan according to those modules, for example in this case the wordpress_version_scan sends a request to the ""/wp-admin/install.php"" endpoint on the specified target and on all the different ports that are given in the module(80,443 in this case). After that it checks for the response and try to match the provided conditions in the module to the response. If the conditions are satisfied then it outputs it as successful scan and show the output in the graph along with the module name, port and target. If not then it only shows output of the other scans that were successful. In your case it was unable to match the required conditions to get a successful response so it only shows the output of the successful scan i.e. port_scan.

After that it loads your selected module and try to scan according to those modules, for example in this case the wordpress_version_scan sends a request to the ""/wp-admin/install.php"" endpoint on the specified target and on all the different ports that are given in the module(80,443 in this case). After that it checks for the response and try to match the provided conditions in the module to the response. If the conditions are satisfied then it outputs it as successful scan and show the output in the graph along with the module name, port and target. If not then it only shows output of the other scans that were successful. In your case it was unable to match the required conditions to get a successful response so it only shows the output of the successful scan i.e. port_scan. I will look into this scan module to find why it wasn't working for you, but usually if it detects something it will show you the output.

PS: You can look at how the scans are being done by turning on the verbose output using the -v argument.

Hope this helps.

Captain-T2004 on (2024-03-03 15:58:57 UTC): Took me a while to figure it out but i found out why it was not working. The problem was a missing ""www"", So as the target you put in didn't contain a www the requests sent to the target didn't contain it either and due to some reason the response is altered(in this case there is no response from the target if the end point is accessed without the www in the url). I have tested the wordpress_version_scan module and can confirm it works. I am attaching the results below.

Command used: ""python3 nettacker.py -i https://www.arkoselabs.com -m wordpress_version_scan""

By asking to scan https://arkoselabs.com Nettacker is connecting to the precise target and that target  does not have wordpress - the response from the server is a 301 redirect which Nettacker is not following intentionally (because that would take the scan to a different target taking the pen test/scan ""out of scope"" (sorry I have to explain this: ""staying in scope of an engagement"" a concept familiar to people who perform penetration testing/bug bounty ad it means that the security tester are only testing what they are explicitly allowed/authorised to test).   


If you wish to scan all subdomains of arkoseblabs.com the command you should have used:

`python nettacker.py --skip-service-discovery -i arkoselabs.com -m wordpress_version_scan -s 
`

the 
`-s
`

means ""run all the modules listed for all subdomains of the target""


Before scanning any target with Nettacker make sure you have explicit permission (either a security penetration testing contract/agreement or being in-scope of the Bug Bounty programme which allows to run security scans on target subdomains/IP addresses

at the moment Nettacker WebUI does not have any pagination - only 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons are shown for navigation. We need a pagination feature allowing the user to navigate between pages, jump to a specific page as well as the first page and last page (see attached screenshot explaining proposed functionality)

2055926411,issue,open,,Reorganize Profile Section in Web Module for Improved Usability,"## Issue Summary:
The current profile section in the web module appears cluttered with multiple protocols and products, making it challenging for users to navigate and select profiles efficiently. This issue proposes reorganizing the profile section to enhance user experience.

## Proposed Changes:

- **Separate Section for Profiles:**
  Introduce a separate section for profiles to declutter the existing profile selection interface.

- **Improved Categorization:**
  Group profiles based on protocols and products to make it more intuitive for users.

#### Screenshot:

## Implementation Plan:

- Identify the relevant HTML templates and JavaScript files responsible for rendering the web interface.
- Introduce modifications to separate the profile section and improve categorization.

## Benefits:

- Enhances user experience by providing a more organized and user-friendly profile selection interface.
- Simplifies the process of selecting profiles, especially when dealing with multiple protocols and products.

Hi! in my program that i made to use nettacker i would like to replicate a function of the real UI , the function where you go on crawler and click on a host and inside there is a html table with all the events of that host. i currently did it with /logs/get_json?target=192.168.254.12, in response to that i get this json:

the problem here is that the module name is missing, if we go on the nettacker UI and press on a host we see a table with the same data that i have in the json but there is also the module name, which i can't figure out where is located.

1795382255,issue,closed,completed,ssh_brute: Detect open dropbear server,"# Issue

Currently, the brute modules (at least ssh) do not scan for empty passwords.

*Update: This does not seem to affect openssh servers and could only be reproduced on dropbear ssh servers so far.*

# Setup

Container running an open SSH server (aka, user=root, password="""") in the same network as the Nettacker container.
I can successfully connect to the SSH server from inside the Nettacker container using `ssh root@<ip>` without password prompt.

# Expected behavior

Nettacker should detect a passwordless SSH server.

# Actual behaviour

1. By default, Nettacker does not attempt to connect without password.
2. Running `python3 nettacker.py -v -i <ip> -m ssh_brute -u ""root"" -p """"` will fall back to default password list (since passwords is empty)
3. Creating a passwordlist file only containing a newline and running `python3 nettacker.py -v -i <ip> -m ssh_brute -u ""root"" --passwords-list=passwords.txt` will use an empty password, but will still fail to detect the open SSH server:  
```

Captain-T2004 on (2024-02-07 16:29:54 UTC): @Jasper-Ben, while recreating this issue. I have found that nettacker is successfully able to identify the open ssh server. I have created a password less ssh server running on a docker container to recreate the issue.

Dockerfile to build the ssh server container:
***
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openssh-server

RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash myuser
RUN echo ""myuser:""| chpasswd -e

RUN mkdir /var/run/sshd
COPY sshd_config /etc/ssh/
RUN passwd -d myuser
EXPOSE 22

CMD [""/usr/sbin/sshd"", ""-D""]
***

sshd_config file:
***
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitEmptyPasswords yes
PubkeyAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
***
Nettacker version:0.3.2
OS: Pop OS 22.04

If you have setup the ssh server in any other way kindly share the details...
![image](https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker/assets/126911424/c4778e0a-71a0-4e8d-9871-6f8f9ede768b)

Jasper-Ben (Issue Creator) on (2024-02-07 16:39:36 UTC): @Captain-T2004 huh, interesting. I will check again soon (hopefully tomorrow)

Jasper-Ben (Issue Creator) on (2024-02-07 17:37:50 UTC): Ok, I couldn't let it rest until tomorrow :sweat_smile:

So the ""good"" news is: I am (probably) not stupid, in my setup I am still unable to detect the open SSH server.

```bash
# ssh root@172.20.0.2
root@b4a70f4bb3f1:~# 
```

```bash
# python3 nettacker.py -v -i 172.20.0.2 -m ssh_brute

+----------------------------+------------+-------------+------+----------+
|            date            |   target   | module_name | port |   logs   |
+============================+============+=============+======+==========+
| 2024-02-07 17:25:35.715329 | 172.20.0.2 | port_scan   | 22   | Detected |
+----------------------------+------------+-------------+------+----------+
| 2024-02-07 17:25:35.723765 | 172.20.0.2 | port_scan   | 80   | Detected |
+----------------------------+------------+-------------+------+----------+
```

Unfortunately, I cannot publish the ssh server container here for IP reasons, but I will try to reproduce this behavior in a minimal setup.

Noteworthy: We are using dropbear and not openssh, so first thing I will try again with an open dropbear server on an off-the-shelf Debian container

Jasper-Ben (Issue Creator) on (2024-02-07 18:12:54 UTC): P.S.: can you please send me the command you used to run nettacker? Maybe I'm doing something wrong there?

Jasper-Ben (Issue Creator) on (2024-02-07 19:13:27 UTC): Ok, I was able to reproduce the issue with the following Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM debian:bookworm-slim

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y dropbear \
    && passwd --delete root \
    && rm -rf /var/apt/lists

CMD [""/usr/sbin/dropbear"", ""-B"", ""-F""] 
```
Using your Dockerfile I was able to detect the open SSH server.

So this indeed is related to dropbear... :thinking: I still think this is a valid issue, since detection should work regardless of SSH server implementation. I will change the title accordingly though.

Jasper-Ben (Issue Creator) on (2024-02-07 19:24:20 UTC): I also just double checked: Nettacker **will** detect a dropbear server with a weak password (e.g.: `python3 nettacker.py -v -i 172.20.0.4 -m ssh_brute -u root -p ""root""`) so this issue really is limited to dropbear without a password.

securestep9 (Assginee) on (2024-02-07 23:00:48 UTC): If you look at how SSH module is implemented in Nettacker you will see that it is using Paramiko here:==>

https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker/blob/e71b449b900cf2b4b289dacdb58adb7351c37328/core/module_protocols/core_ssh.py#L21

The Dropbear authentication It is apparently a known issue with Paramiko according to this StackOverflow article: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71749222/paramiko-authentication-to-server-with-no-password-fails  - the same article suggests a workaround:

```
client = paramiko.SSHClient()
client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
# Workaround for no authentication:
# https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/890#issuecomment-906893725
try:
    client.connect(host, port=port, username=username, password=password)
except paramiko.ssh_exception.AuthenticationException as e:
    if not password:
        client.get_transport().auth_none(username)
    else:
        raise e

```
@Jasper-Ben - are you able to test that the StackOverflow-suggested workaround fixes your problem with Dropbear in your local fork of Nettacker? If yes, feel free to submit a PR

Captain-T2004 on (2024-02-08 06:24:45 UTC): @Jasper-Ben, I tried the fix and it worked. After recreating ssh server from the Dockerfile you gave and updating my version of Nettacker to the latest(0.3.3), i tried the above metioned fix and it worked.
***
Here i have 2 dropbear ssh running on localhost ports 22 and 2222 and it was able to detect both.

Jasper-Ben (Issue Creator) on (2024-02-08 08:35:58 UTC): Nice catch @securestep9! And thanks for testing it @Captain-T2004! 🥳

Jasper-Ben (Issue Creator) on (2024-02-08 08:40:20 UTC): Looking at the original issue report in paramiko, there are also improvements in the pipeline that might fix this: https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/890#issuecomment-1736567046

This can be very useful for recon as some redirections can be going to a subdomain/URL not exposed anywhere else, the redirection can go to a login page and include an auth token/session id in the URL etc. 

Additionally understanding the redirections within subdomains can help you identify any unauthorised or malicious redirects that may have been set up by cybercriminals.

1384732871,issue,open,,multi threading issue,"Hi,

1. There is an issue with the queues. When a request is dependent on another request, all queued requests will constantly check for the same variable in the temp events of the database. So we need to generate those requests after the variable is available and stop consuming the CPU.
2. if threads of one subprocess are finished, the subprocess will die. Maybe it's better to let the subprocesses help other subprocesses with their threads. 

Thanks, Ali.

1086115643,issue,closed,completed,Having nettacker in the PATH,"Right now the issue is that the installation directory is totally arbitrary and the install instructions doesn't prescribe to create a symlink in a directory that is accessible in the PATH. 

I'de propose to add the required steps in the installation docs such that Nettacker would be installed in `/opt/Nettacker/` and a symlink `/usr/local/bin/nettacker` is created. 

So the ""Install Requirements"" section would read as follows
```
git clone https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker.git /opt/
cd /opt/Nettacker/
apt-get update
apt-get install -y < requirements-apt-get.txt
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt
ln -s /opt/Nettacker/nettacker.py /usr/local/bin/nettacker
```

With the note: This will install Nettacker under `/opt/Nettacker/` and create a symlink in `/usr/local/bin/`. Feel free to adjust this to your needs.

I think we should modify it for better user experience.
One more thing, I guess Windows platform is no longer supported by Nettacker so we should remove the word ['Windows' in `error_platform` key](https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker/blob/master/lib/messages/hi.yaml#L56).

The only change i made is database name in config.py

I figured I would get similar error if I choose Postgres too.. So I didn't tried that

Ali-Razmjoo on (2021-09-21 18:16:41 UTC): In the new version of nettacker, we changed some tables, which messed up the old version. Soon, we will migrate to elastic search, and Redis and I am unsure if we can continue supporting this due to the many limitations it causes us.

@securestep9 @itsdivyanshjain @aman566 any of you can work on a script maybe to migrate the old db to the new one?

murkeh217 (Issue Creator) on (2021-09-22 00:34:15 UTC): @Ali-Razmjoo What was the need for changing tables if migration wasn't initiated at all?

Ali-Razmjoo on (2021-09-23 10:58:27 UTC): I know it's an old project, but we are not even in beta, still in r&d phase and we don't think twice which is bad :D but so you know. you can keep using version 0.0.2, we just change the architecture in 0.0.3 and when it's a bit more clean code and bug-free we gonna go to next phase to add more stuff, then you might need to update...

murkeh217 (Issue Creator) on (2021-09-23 13:41:28 UTC): @Ali-Razmjoo 

Ah, OK. I learned a lot from this tool, please do update it new architecture, I will be waiting for it!

I just have one more request, can you update the docker image to 0.0.2 as well? I'm not sure if it is the 0.0.2 version right now or not but I felt it was outdated cause it didn't worked on my machine. I tried creating my own docker image but was struggling and came to a dead end due to some version conflict in modules.

Ali-Razmjoo on (2021-09-23 19:59:47 UTC): There is a `Dockerfile` in the directory of version 0.0.2. So all you need to do is download the v0.0.2 from [here](https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker/tags) and then you have two to go forward:

1- build the image yourself.
```bash
docker build . -t nettacker
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd):/usr/src/owaspnettacker:Z  -it nettacker /bin/bash
python nettacker.py
```
2- use docker-compose
```
docker-compose up -d --build && docker exec -it nettacker_nettacker_1 /bin/bash
python nettacker.py
```
* notice, I used `--build` to make sure if there is an older version of the image, it will replace it, but once you build it, you can use `docker-compose up -d && docker exec -it nettacker_nettacker_1 /bin/bash` so you don't wait for the build.
* also, docker-compose expose port 5000. You can access it by opening it in the browser.
* to check if docker container is running use, `docker ps`
* to kill the background docker container, use `docker-compose down`


And I recommend before running scans, sync with the `master` branch with `git pull`. We update this project very frequently.

murkeh217 (Issue Creator) on (2021-09-24 02:02:42 UTC): @Ali-Razmjoo 

Thank you so much! The explanation on usage of docker image was very helpful.

Understanding version changes and releases is quite important, haha

Ali-Razmjoo on (2021-09-24 09:30:08 UTC): please let me know if you have more feature requests, or questions. we will be more glad to help.

Nettacker does have set of messages, but when it breaks it goes for an exception and print the particular line from a set of messages which may be deceptive. In case of issue #398 it's showing `module port_scan is not available` and while debugging we get to know about an issue which is `importerror` in port_scan module. So, here clearly we didn't handle exception clearly well. Remember using `exception as e` is not a solution as well, the important thing is to improve exception handling.

P.s: currently Nettacker going from lot of changes because of that you should wait for changes to merge then send PR if you want any improvement.

The tool should first check the cms it is using by calling wappalyzer or whatcms modules and then detect if any WordPress cms is present or not. If it has cms then it should go for WordPress modules, else should skip that subdomain for WordPress checks.

587473023,issue,closed,completed,[Medium] Multiple logical bugs within header_xss module,"The `header_xss` module, contains the following on line 34:
```
        r = requests.head(host)
        for header in r.headers:
            headers_xss[header] = payloads_xss
        req = requests.post(host, headers=headers_xss)
        if payloads_xss.lower() in req.text.lower():
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
So what the engine does is, it makes a HEAD request to the site, and then it iterates over the received headers from the HEAD request and adds them to the already existing `headers_xss` dictionary. By doing this we are actually violating the w3 standards defined in RFC 7230-7235. 

A quick glance at the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Request_fields) says a lot about the specific set of header fields which can be used during a client request. But, when we are appending the set of response header fields, to the request header set, we are defying the standard.

Elaborately explaining, taking the following example:
- Site: http://www.webscantest.com
- Making the HEAD request, yeilds the following headers:
```
{
'Date': 'Wed, 25 Mar 2020 06:05:32 GMT', 
'Server': 'Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)', 
'X-Powered-By': 'PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.29', 
'Set-Cookie': 'TEST_SESSIONID=ak6b8793njuaai9lns68ka9q54; path=/, NB_SRVID=srv140717; path=/', 
'Expires': 'Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT', 
'Cache-Control': 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0', 
'Pragma': 'no-cache', 
'Connection': 'close', 
'Content-Type': 'text/html'
}
```
- Performing the dict transformation: `for header in r.headers: headers_xss[header] = payloads_xss`, the header set we get is:
```
{
'User-Agent': '<script>alert()</script>', 
'Except': '<script>alert()</script>',
'Accept-Encoding': '<script>alert()</script>', 
'Referer': '<script>alert()</script>', 
'Accept-Language': '<script>alert()</script>', 
'Date': '<script>alert()</script>', 
'Server': '<script>alert()</script>', 
'X-Powered-By': '<script>alert()</script>', 
'Set-Cookie': '<script>alert()</script>', 
'Expires': '<script>alert()</script>', 
'Cache-Control': '<script>alert()</script>', 
'Pragma': '<script>alert()</script>', 
'Connection': '<script>alert()</script>', 
'Content-Type': '<script>alert()</script>'
}
```
Now if we are performing the POST request using this set of headers, we are violating the client-server model, since we are both using the header set of a server as well as the browser/client lol.

Also, I see we are making a POST request without any data?

Also, the `payloads_xss` value is set to `<script>alert(/1/)</script>` which is a HTML context payload. I think we should support javascript context based payloads as well as reflected input based contexts too, since we are never sure how and where the input is getting reflected/stored!

I maybe wrong in my understanding hence ccing @pradeepjairamani, the author of the code. He might have other intentions while writing the code, hence I'm open to a quality discussion. :)",0xInfection,2020-03-25 06:29:55+00:00,[],2021-02-02 21:35:16+00:00,2021-02-02 21:35:16+00:00,https://github.com/OWASP/Nettacker/issues/239,"[('bug', None)]",[],

Would anyone want to spend time on a call or two to help me understand some of the commands? Some of them aren't obvious to me from the command line help, so they might benefit from better explanation.

(I'll continue to work on this section, but having a technical expert to answer some of the questions would be great.)

I think this section would work better by expanding and re-organizing, with the following outline: 

USAGE 

1.) The setup commands  (with a description and example for each)
-language
-verbosity 
- version
- update 
- log in file
- graph 
- help
- wizard 
- profile

2.) Basic command usage
- The base syntax of CLI commands (nettacker -i <targets> -m <methods>)
-Everything you need to know about the targets-related commands (including lists)
-Everything you need to know about the methods-related commands (such as excluding)

3.) More advanced commands 
- users
- users_list
- passwords
- passwords_list
- ports
- timout
- time_sleep
- range
- subdomains
- thread number
- thread_number_host
- socks_proxy
- retries
- ping_before_scan
- methods_args

335197749,issue,closed,completed,Documentation: Installation ,"Two bigger changes that I think would make the installation chapter better:

1.) Fix use of the term ""requirements."" It appears that it is being used in different ways, which will confuse your end users:

* The summary at the beginning says there are multiple ways to install, including on this list ""requirements,"" which is not exactly a mode of installation.
*The list of pre-requisite software appeared under the heading ""requirements."" I changed this to ""prerequisites,"" but this calls attention to the issue more than fixing it. 
*There is a script called requirements that installs the actual components of OWASP nettacker. 

Here's what I'd like to do: 
* Move prerequisites higher up in the chapter, because they should be checked before installation begins. Maybe a new section up above installation methods would do it. 
* Remove ""requirements"" from that list of installation methods 

Let me know if I've misinterpreted anything here. 

2.) Add a support matrix at the top of the installation page, with more detailed information about supported versions of operating systems (e.g. what OSs are actually tested) and any info about problems with individual versions of Python. I would need some feedback for that. 

(I see that there's a line or two in the introduction, but more would be better.)

335140059,issue,closed,completed,Documentation: README ,"There are some confusing sentences in the README for OWASP-Nettacker.

In the paragraph that starts on line 23 of the README file (""OWASP Nettacker project is created to automate. . ."") The last three sentences are difficult to decipher. Here's what they say: 

""This software will utilize TCP SYN, ACK, ICMP and many other protocols in order to detect and bypass firewall/IDS/IPS devices. By leveraging a unique method in OWASP Nettacker for discovering protected services and devices such as SCADA. It would make a competitive edge compared to other scanner making it one of the best.""

1.) In that first sentence I can't tell whether the capability exists now or will exist later. 
2.) The next two sentences are incomplete. I can't quite revise these because I'm not sure whether this unique method is the main thing that Nettacker does, or just one of the things. And I might reword this in a way that makes it incorrect.

334426989,issue,closed,completed,long startup time,"Hello,

While I was testing the framework, I've noticed, it takes a while to run and load module for a simple port scan, but when it's in API mode, it starts immediately, it's simply because in API mode modules are currently loaded on RAM (maybe?) but in CLI it's not, BTW it should not take long like that, if we keep adding modules it will be a waste of time to keep waiting for CLI scans. We need to find out where we've done wrong and fix it up.

328631651,issue,closed,completed,Improve Service Scanner Signatures,"Hello,

Thanks to @pradeepjairamani for contribution #148, now we have a service scanner, which we need to improve by adding more signatures in it! there are a few documents for its usage in [here](https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Nettacker/tree/master/lib/payload/scanner/service) and also its implemented in `port_scan` module!

To add signatures, you may take a look at the conditions in [engine.py](https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Nettacker/blob/master/lib/payload/scanner/service/engine.py#L23).

there are two types of conditions, first one is `and` conditions. it contains an array of conditions, conditions type could be a string or an array. if the condition type is the string, then it must be in the response data, if it's array, one of the strings in the array must be in the response data. for instance:
```python
[True and True [True or False or True] and True]
```
a real example condition:
```python
ports_services_and_condition = {
    ""http"": [[""HTTP/0.9"", ""HTTP/1.0"", ""HTTP/1.1"", ""HTTP/2.0""]],
    ""ftp"": [""FTP"", [""214"", ""220"", ""530"", ""230"", ""502"", ""500""]],
    ""ssh"": [""SSH""],
    ""telnet"": [""Telnet""],
    ""smtp"": [""SMTP"", [""220"", ""554"", ""250""]],
    ""imap"": [""IMAP""],
    ""mariadb"": [""MariaDB""],
    ""mysql"": [""MySQL""],
}
```

the second type of condition is `or`, it contains an array of conditions, conditions type could be a string or an array. if the condition is a string, one of the strings must be in response data or if it's an array, all of the strings in the array must be in the response data. for instance:

```python
[True or True or [True and False and True] or True]
```
a real example condition:

```python
ports_services_or_condition = {
    ""http"": [""400 Bad Request"", ""401 Unauthorized"", ""302 Found"", ""Server: cloudflare"", ""404 Not Found"", ""HTML"", ""Content-Length:"", ""Content-Type:""],
    ""ftp"": [[""Pure-FTPd"", ""----------\r\n""], ""\r\n220-You are user number"", [""orks FTP server"", ""VxWorks VxWorks""],
            ""530 USER and PASS required"", ""Server ready.\r\n5"", ""Invalid command: try being more creative"", ""220 Hotspot FTP server (MikroTik 6.27) ready"", ""220 SHARP MX-M264N Ver 01.05.00.0n.16.U FTP server."",

    ""ssh"": [""-OpenSSH_"", ""\r\nProtocol mism"", ""_sshlib GlobalSCAPE\r\n"", ""\x00\x1aversion info line too long""],
    ""telnet"": [""Welcome to Microsoft Telnet Service"", ""no decompiling or reverse-engineering shall be allowed"",
               ""is not a secure protocol"", ""recommended to use Stelnet"", ""Login authentication""],
    ""smtp"": [""Server ready"", ""SMTP synchronization error"", ""220-Greetings"", ""ESMTP Arnet Email Security"", ""SMTP 2.0"",
             ""Fidelix Fx2020""],
    ""imap"": [""BAD Error in IMAP command received by server"", ""IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR"", ""OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1"",
             ""LITERAL+ SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE NAMESPACE AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=LOGIN]"",
             ""LITERAL+ SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE AUTH=PLAIN AUTH=LOGIN AUTH=DIGEST-MD5 AUTH=CRAM-MD5]""],

    ""mysql"": [""is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server""]
}
```

You can collect the data and find services from [shodan.io](https://shodan.io), or use `discovery()` on your network and find out which port/service is `UNKNOWN`. then grab some signatures and add it to the framework.

```python
In [1]: from lib.payload.scanner.service.engine import discovery

In [2]: discovery(""127.0.0.1"")
Out[2]:
{80: 'http',
 443: 'http/ssl',
 445: 'UNKNOWN',
 902: 'UNKNOWN',
 912: 'UNKNOWN',
 2179: 'UNKNOWN',
 3306: 'mariadb',

I think this is due to non closing of socket connections. The previous sockets are waiting for results and are interfering into my newer scans.

pradeepjairamani on (2018-06-26 01:35:11 UTC): I think this is due to the function returning data without waiting for the thread to complete, I will work on this issue.

317056849,issue,closed,completed,Implementing Service scanning in OWASP-Nettacker,"OWASP-Nettacker currently lacks the power of scanning a network for running services
before doing vulnerability assessment and sending payloads; hence every attack can end up
useless if the service is running at a different port.
Let’s take an example, when doing network scanning if a Secure Socket Layer is running on a
port or if the port is using an SSL tunnel in order to protect its users from MITM attack then we
first scan that service for SSL vulnerabilities like CCS injection, Heartbleed, Logjam, Poodle,
and many others in order to keep the tunnel secure and the user’s data protected, this will boost the discovery rate of vulnerabilities.

For services like SSH, SMTP, FTP and other common services we will be using normal banner
grabbing techniques where Python sockets will be used. A typical FTP banner gives us
information about the product and version being used on FTP service that is Bftpd 1.6.6 which
could enumerate multiple vulnerabilities without sending any payloads to the server.

`[+] 192.168.2.1:220 bftpd 1.6.6 at 192.168.2.1 ready.`

For services like HTTP/HTTPS, we will be using Python-Requests module which will be helpful
for detecting the server running by header information, a typical header looks like this which
gives us information about the running services & version on the port which is Nginx/1.10.3 and
the OS details which is Linux Ubuntu.

`({'date': 'Thu, 08 Mar 2018 14:23:48 GMT', 'connection': 'keep-alive', 'content-encoding': 'gzip',

'server': 'nginx/1.10.3 (Ubuntu)', 'transfer-encoding': 'chunked'})`

Many DNS servers are pre-configured with version information in DNS TXT records for the version bind label in the CHAOS class.

`dig @dns.name.server version.bind chaos txt`

Typical answers might include

`;; ANSWER SECTION:
version.bind. 0 CH TXT ""9.8.1-P1""`
OR
`;; ANSWER SECTION:
version.bind. 1476526080 IN TXT ""Microsoft DNS 6.1.7600 (1DB04228)""`
OR
`;; ANSWER SECTION:
version.bind. 0 CH TXT ""dnsmasq-2.47""`

Same can be implemented using **nslookup** ​for Windows ​system.

Currently I am working on this. And my whole idea to get service information. If port is open then
it may give  easily banner grabbing. But when any port  is filtered then we bypass it by fragmentation 
of IP-address.

pradeepjairamani (Issue Creator) on (2018-04-24 19:04:18 UTC): @VictorSuraj I don't understand the part fragmentation of Ip-address.
I will be using normal socket connect for open port detection, please explain your idea.

Best Regards

VictorSuraj on (2018-04-24 19:14:04 UTC): fragmentation means as a spoofed ip-address for the server where we want to send our packets.
socket well work in banner grabbing but sometimes it is failed. because of, if server self response
about there service then we grab banner through socket. But If server is not configured to give any response  then socket failed there.

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-04-24 19:16:59 UTC): Hey @VictorSuraj,

Is this need to create a raw socket? can you share a few references for your idea, it seems cool!

Regards.

VictorSuraj on (2018-04-24 19:17:20 UTC): fragmentation means not a spoofed ip-address but firewall of server cant detect our IP-address.
because  our IP-address information goes in server as in fragments(8-bit or 16-bit at a time of total 32-bit.)

abiusx on (2018-04-24 19:21:20 UTC): @VictorSuraj Can you please point to a scenario in which a socket attempt is not useful by fragmentation is? Please describe a service that we can setup and test, so that we can work on the solution.

VictorSuraj on (2018-04-24 19:22:22 UTC): my code is not currently ready. But I have a simple example.
Some times while scanning about in services by nmap a output comes out as "" server block our ping probes"". So here we use a switch -Pn .   I see some working of switch -Pn used by nmap.
And I found that it sends our IP-address in fragments.

VictorSuraj on (2018-04-24 19:24:56 UTC): switch ""-Pn"" used in nmap for bypass firewall so my idea to grab enough  information about any port's services. I am using scapy for this task. Scapy covered many points at a time so that our code work much faster and determine more information.

abiusx on (2018-04-24 19:27:02 UTC): Yes, but ping uses ICMP protocol which is a lower level protocol compared to TCP, so it can not be done with sockets. However, all TCP services work with a socket.

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-04-24 19:27:35 UTC): I am not sure about nmap structure, but in the help menu says ` -Pn: Treat all hosts as online -- skip host discovery`, I though nmap use SYN/ACK to bypass some firewalls and grab information (such as OS and OS Version)

pradeepjairamani (Issue Creator) on (2018-04-24 19:28:47 UTC): @VictorSuraj  switch -Pn is not a firewall evasion technique, It just doesn't checks if the server is offline or online and scans all the open ports.

VictorSuraj on (2018-04-24 19:33:58 UTC): @abiusx 
While connecting to a filtered port. socket can not work here. A timeout definitely comes out.
So for this purpose we need fragmentation and I think nettacker used scapy. And we can do a lot
with this. please If you give me some more about socket in fragmentation then send me. I read it
and response  soon.

pradeepjairamani (Issue Creator) on (2018-04-24 19:38:34 UTC): @VictorSuraj  I haven't worked much with scapy, but can you demonstrate a code where we can see different closed ports and filtered ports?

Best Regards

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-04-24 19:38:39 UTC): correct, we used scapy, but I will glad if we can find or create a replacement, we already have some license issues, if we can remove requirements it would us so much, so any contribution in this area are so welcomed.

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-04-24 19:44:08 UTC): @pradeepjairamani thanks for mentioning this, I also looking forward to see a sample code to improve our libraries. 

in any case if you need a test server to scan, we have a closed port `3389` on our server `nettacker.z3r0d4y.com`  that you have permission to do all your tests. also, you are permitted to do test for the filtered ports on `zdresearch.com`.

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-06-01 19:02:30 UTC): Hello,

We've done it in #148, so I'd mark it as done, and create a new issue to improve the signatures!

Regards.

"
317055445,issue,closed,completed,Implementing Text/JSON Database for non-fuzzer based vulnerabilities,"In Non-fuzzer based Network Vulnerability tests, there is no fuzzing and all the tests are done using information of the services running on the port like product and version detection of the service.
Take an example of Proftpd which is one of the most common FTP services across Linux
systems. There are many exploits for the older versions of Proftpd

[ProFTPd CVEDetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/product/16873/Proftpd-Proftpd.html?vendor_id=9520)

Just the product and version detection of those services can be used to find vulnerabilities inside
a network and the vendors update the product instead of sending patches to the users.

To implement this functionality, we will create new modules or create a database of vulnerable
versions of different products that are running on different services.

This will make the testing faster; more modules will be added in a short time and also these tests
won't harm the system as these tests only use banner grabbing technique

As you know, OWASP Nettacker logs every event in the database, after a while, you will have enough data to use them for machine learning to find the risks easier.

316963435,issue,closed,completed,Update Switch,"Hello,

As you know, the update switch is a decorate now and does not work, I did not add it because we had not any release! before adding this feature I want to ask the ideas to get to know our users.

As you can see in the [core/update.py](https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Nettacker/blob/master/core/update.py), I `http://nettacker.z3r0d4y.com/version.py` to check the latest version number from GitHub and compare it with users version to tell if the latest or not, but I could do it by directly with requesting to the GitHub.

The reason I did not do that, it's because GitHub won't share us the analytics and information regarding our users, by that method I could see where the users come from (at least) by their IP location, to guess and provide the languages they may use in the framework. also as you know, check for update is a startup event, so I could understand how many times our scanner begin used (not accurate because it could be used in local networks or check for the update could be disabled in [config.py](https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Nettacker/blob/master/core/config.py#L111)).

BTW I was thinking if we could get more legal/public information about our users (like the operation system, python version, etc) to do more tests and provide better service. but keep in mind we cannot touch any sensitive information to prevent any information leakage and more. We can do it on the ""User-Agent"" while the user is connecting to our server to check for updates.

We can also show the information on a graph to the public on our website (like must used by GEO, python versions, OS type and so on).

The reason for this update is I am feeling we are wasting our time on supporting Windows OS, the data will define our path and focus.

let me know if you have any idea regarding this.

thanks for the comments. 

@shaddygarg OWASP ZSC codes are a little bit messy, but it has a great document in gitbook. feel free to look it up.
@pradeepjairamani great idea to make msfvenom optional.

let me know if anyone has any ideas and think its cool to make this feature available on this project.

@pradeepjairamani your password generator could be located in `lib/payload/password_generator`, feel free to create some new payload and generators for the project (Y).

I will add a few documents regarding the shellcodes soon! meanwhile, you can check out OWASP ZSC docs on gitbook.

pradeepjairamani (Issue Creator) on (2018-03-13 15:20:21 UTC): Every Vulnerability has a CVE, and by searching that CVE we can find all the details about it.
Ex: For Bftpd_double_free vulnerability module 
https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2007-2010/
we can find the specific data from cvedetails,
it also has details about if any metsploit exploit exist for the vulnerability.

pradeepjairamani (Issue Creator) on (2018-03-13 15:33:22 UTC): The score on CVE details is defined by CVSS which is a widely used method for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities.

I think its best to add more details into JSON structure for events and the database, hence @shaddygarg is working on the new SQL schema, I think its best to wait until its finished. what do you thing Shaddy?

Ali-Razmjoo (Assginee) on (2018-04-09 11:38:37 UTC): * `so I don't think that this will affect my migration.`
it requires modifying the database, are you sure about that?

shaddygarg on (2018-04-09 11:59:43 UTC): Oh, I get it. This will not change the way we query from the database but will affect the queries which are used to log data into the database.

according to #60 issue, the `core/args_loader.py` is not working well and does not consider all possible commands. we can add a task to replace `--method-args port_scan_stealth` with `--method-args port_scan_stealth=True`. the default values for any `key` would be `True`.

e.g. `--method-args port_scan_stealth&port_scan_ports=1,2,3&dir_scan_random_agent` would be equal to `--method-args port_scan_stealth=True&port_scan_ports=1,2,3&dir_scan_random_agent=True`

JeckyOH on (2018-03-27 22:02:00 UTC): @Ali-Razmjoo 
The reason of this issue is the ImportError of pycurl module in lib.brute.http_ntlm.py.
The error looks like this: 
`ImportError: pycurl: libcurl link-time ssl backend (openssl) is different from compile-time ssl backend (none/other)`
It is apparent that pycurl is compiled without specifying the backend as openssl.
Here is the solution: [Solution of different backend of PyCurl between link time and compile time](http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/install.html).
Just reinstall pycurl with specifying the backend as openssl:
`pip uninstall pycurl` 
`echo PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=openssl` 
`pip install --compile pycurl`
I have tried to use this method on Linux Ubuntu and it can solve this issue. However, in Mac OS 10.13, it failed.
Because this is the error of compiling PyCurl, which is installed through requirements.txt and I`m afraid of disrupting the structure of the project, I cannot provide a PR to solve this problem.

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-04-24 14:54:18 UTC): Hey @JeckyOH, 

Thanks for the details, I'm getting an error too and should be review and fix soon.

I cannot find any bugs either. in a few days, I will test and emulate all modules recently added to the framework to find the bugs.

304078856,issue,closed,completed,New language library,"Hello,

As the framework is growing, I think the existing language library I created to keep the message is not good enough for a bigger framework, using numbers make conflicts in PRs. I think it's better to change it before framework gets bigger.

my idea is, use the same libs structure, but use messages instead of numbers.


```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-


def all_messages():
    """"""
    keep all messages in en
    Returns:
        all messages in JSON
    """"""

            ""help_menu"": ""Show Nettacker Help Menu"",
             etc...
        }

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-03-10 17:54:59 UTC): Hello,

thank you for your question, no English is in priority, also it just needs to change the identifier number, and find the message in the framework and replace it.
e.g.
```
message(language, ""start_message"")
```

Regards.

pradeepjairamani on (2018-03-10 20:27:36 UTC): I am having a little trouble understanding the problem.

like for example, we are giving numbers (1-180) for messages in our current method for fetching data from languages, you want me to change them from 
def all_messages():
 ``   return 
        {
            ""0"": ""Nettacker engine started ...\n\n"",
            ""1"": ""python nettacker.py [options]"",
            ""2"": ""Show Nettacker Help Menu"",
            ""3"": ""Please read license and agreements https://github.com/viraint$
            ""4"": ""Engine"",
            ""5"": ""Engine input options"",
            ""6"": ""select a language {0}"",
            ""7"": ""scan all IPs in the range"",
}``

to

``   return 
        {
            ""scan_started"": ""Nettacker engine started ...\n\n"",
            ""options"": ""python nettacker.py [options]"",
            ""help_menu"": ""Show Nettacker Help Menu"",
            ""license"": ""Please read license and agreements https://github.com/viraint$
            ""engine"": ""Engine"",
            ""input_options"": ""Engine input options"",
            ""select_lang"": ""select a language {0}"",
            ""scan_ip_ranges"": ""scan all IPs in the range"",
}``

in all the libraries as well as in the /lib/language/messages_en.py

so can I add those names scan_started, options, help_menu, license, etc. by myself or do I need to follow any method?

Best Regards

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-03-10 22:19:44 UTC): Hey,

if you mean choosing an id name, yes you may do it yourself, there are no any methods, just you may see what are they about and change them.

your example is also fine.

```
return { ""scan_started"": ""Nettacker engine started ...\n\n"", ""options"": ""python nettacker.py [options]"", ""help_menu"": ""Show Nettacker Help Menu"", ""license"": ""Please read license and agreements https://github.com/viraint$ ""engine"": ""Engine"", ""input_options"": ""Engine input options"", ""select_lang"": ""select a language {0}"", ""scan_ip_ranges"": ""scan all IPs in the range"", }
```

pallav12 on (2020-10-26 16:49:05 UTC): Hello, 
icmp_scannning is just a way to know if target is active, we can do this with simple ping like this
``
import os

hostname = ""google.com"" #example

response = os.system(""ping -c 1 "" + hostname)
if response == 0:

  print hostname, 'is up!'

else:

  print hostname, 'is down!'

``
am I missing something?

use `send_submit_query` for insert and delete (those which need commits in db) and `send_read_query` to get results (like `select`)

if there was a helping content that i could use, like how to setup a lab and test the best of it, i could make detailed video tutorials for it. i actually really look forward for code contributions too, but have no spare time for that yet.

shaddygarg (Assginee) on (2018-02-12 21:24:06 UTC): Hello, I would like to work on this issue if no one is currently working on it.

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-02-13 00:47:12 UTC): Hello @shaddygarg,

Thank you for beginning a volunteer, let @ravindra1307 update us if he is working on this?

Best Regards.

ravindra1307 on (2018-02-13 07:45:43 UTC): working on this will update you in a day or two.

hardlyhuman on (2018-02-18 17:14:34 UTC): Hi,
May I know if anyone is working on this? I would like to work if no one is working.

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-03-11 17:47:15 UTC): Hello @ravindra1307,

Would you please update us regarding this feature? let me know if you need any help.

Best Regards.

pradeepjairamani on (2018-03-11 18:29:58 UTC): Can I add another module for subdomain scanning using abusing certificate transparency logs (only available for https website).
More info.
http://www.certificate-transparency.org

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-03-11 19:31:25 UTC): hey @pradeepjairamani,

please if you want to add this, add it as a function in the same module, I used the module in core framework for `-s`/`--sub-domain` switch.

Regards.

pradeepjairamani on (2018-03-12 04:40:26 UTC): Or I can add a new scan method ctfr_subdomain_scan

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-03-12 10:43:20 UTC): Hello,

in that case, we need to add another mode to the core, but if you'd add it to the existing module, that would be better. this module already has a few resources, it could be a good improvement.

```python
def extra_requirements_dict():
    return {
        ""subdomain_scan_use_netcraft"": [""True""],
        ""subdomain_scan_use_dnsdumpster"": [""True""],
        ""subdomain_scan_use_virustotal"": [""True""],
        ""subdomain_scan_use_threatcrowd"": [""True""],
        ""subdomain_scan_use_comodo_crt"": [""True""],
        ""subdomain_scan_use_ptrarchive"": [""True""],
        ""subdomain_scan_use_google_dig"": [""True""],
        ""subdomain_scan_use_cert_spotter"": [""True""],
        ""subdomain_scan_time_limit_seconds"": [""-1""]

        # Must add later!
        # https://censys.io/certificates?q=domain
        # https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/certificates

    }
```

Regards.

pradeepjairamani on (2018-03-13 15:39:38 UTC): Crt.sh method is already implemented in comodo crt. Anything else I can help with?

Best Regards
Pradeep Jairamani

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-03-13 16:03:35 UTC): Hey,

is crt.sh is the same? so you can go with https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/certificates

regards.

shaddygarg (Assginee) on (2018-03-21 16:39:32 UTC): Hey @Ali-Razmjoo,

Can I take up this issue? It has been too long since an update on this issue.

Regards.

pradeepjairamani on (2018-03-21 16:48:45 UTC): I am not currently working on this issue, so you can take it from my side.

Best Regards

aman566 on (2021-02-01 09:36:54 UTC): Are we good to close this issue @Ali-Razmjoo ?
I guess PR #377 #324 Fixed this one

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2021-02-01 13:36:24 UTC): i didn't add https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/certificates but we can add later.

aman566 on (2021-02-01 15:58:36 UTC): Yes I will work and add it ASAP.

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2021-02-01 17:18:46 UTC): @aman566 thanks :)

I'd like to work on this. Can you help me with an approach?

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-02-05 13:26:02 UTC): Hey,

you can see the information is passing to the [start() function](https://github.com/viraintel/OWASP-Nettacker/blob/master/lib/graph/d3_tree_v1/engine.py#L10).

```python
def start(graph_flag, language, data, _HOST, _USERNAME, _PASSWORD, _PORT, _TYPE, _DESCRIPTION)
```
the `data` is generated JSON data from the framework, and it has to be changed to the graph structure. OWASP Nettacker JSON data starts with an array, and then events.

```
# owasp nettacker
[
  {
    ""USERNAME"": """",
    ""CATEGORY"": ""scan"",
    ""SCAN_ID"": ""09561c27ba0220ed95fe872801c63002"",
    ""DESCRIPTION"": ""OPEN PORT"",
    ""SCAN_CMD"": ""nettacker.py -i 127.0.0.1 -m all -t 1000 -u root -p root -o ff.json --exclude viewdns_reverse_ip_lookup_scan"",
    ""HOST"": ""127.0.0.1"",
    ""TIME"": ""2018-02-03 20:00:45"",
    ""PASSWORD"": """",
    ""TYPE"": ""tcp_connect_port_scan"",
    ""PORT"": 22
  }
]
```
but d3 starts with a key `name` and an array `children`, for each `HOST` in OWASP Nettacker event, you need to create a new data in `children` array, and set the `name` equal to `HOST`.

```
{
  ""name"": ""Started Attack"",
  ""children"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""127.0.0.1"",
      ""children"": []
     },
     {
      ""name"": ""192.168.1.2"",
      ""children"": []
     }
  ]
}
```

after that, every `HOST` has an array `children` too and it needs to be filled with events information. in this section, the name is `TYPE` in OWASP Nettacker event (scan_method name). and also name has `children` and it has a name again filled with information with `HOST`, `PORT`, `DESCRIPTION`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`.

```
{
  ""name"": ""Started Attack"",
  ""children"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""127.0.0.1"",
      ""children"": [
         ""name"": ""tcp_connect_port_scan"",
          ""children"": [
            {
              ""name"": ""HOST: 127.0.0.1 PORT: \""22\"" DESCRIPTION: \""OPEN PORT\"" USERNAME: \""\"" PASSWORD: \""\""""
            }
      ]
     },
     {
      ""name"": ""192.168.1.2"",
      ""children"": [
            {
              ""name"": ""HOST: 127.0.0.1 PORT: \""22\"" DESCRIPTION: \""OPEN PORT\"" USERNAME: \""\"" PASSWORD: \""\""""
            }
         ]
     }
  ]
}
```

You need to do JIT in its structure way too.

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-02-05 23:34:48 UTC): Hello,

sorry, I didn't update documents yet! in the last version results folder moved to `~/.owasp-nettacker/results`. it's equal to `C:\Users\user\.owasp-nettacker\results`, `/home/user/.owasp-nettacker/results` ...

that last version error would be fixed after our first release, please ignore that!.

if you want to change the output file, use `-o file.html`, `-o file.txt`, `-o file.json`.

Regards.

avhvr-zz on (2018-02-10 15:21:31 UTC): Hello,

I have an easier way to convert the **data** into **d3** json structure 

```
# creating a normalised_json
normalisedjson = {
	""name"": ""Started attack"",
	""children"": {}
	}

for each_scan in data:

	if each_scan['HOST'] not in normalisedjson['children']:
		normalisedjson['children'].update({each_scan['HOST']:{}})
		normalisedjson['children'][each_scan['HOST']].update({each_scan['TYPE']:[]})

	if each_scan['TYPE'] not in normalisedjson['children'][each_scan['HOST']]:
		normalisedjson['children'][each_scan['HOST']].update({each_scan['TYPE']:[]})

	normalisedjson['children'][each_scan['HOST']][each_scan['TYPE']].append(""HOST:%s, PORT:\""%s\"", DESCRIPTION:\""%s\"",  USERNAME:\""%s\"",  PASSWORD:\""%s\""""
		% (each_scan['HOST'], each_scan['PORT'], each_scan['DESCRIPTION'], each_scan['USERNAME'], each_scan['PASSWORD']))


# creating a d3_json
d3 = {""name"": ""Starting attack"",
	 ""children"": []}

for host in list(normalisedjson['children'].keys()):
	d3[""children""].append({""name"": host, ""children"": [
		{""name"":otype, ""children"": [
		{""name"": description} for description in normalisedjson['children'][host][otype]]} for otype in list(normalisedjson['children'][host].keys()) ]})

```
I'll also do it for **jit** json structure.

294123290,issue,closed,completed,"bug in new function ""core.log.__log_into_file""","Hello,

I was testing the framework with `-t 1000 -M 1000` threads and I've seen sometimes there is a deadlock in this function.  Now the framework has a small SQLite database which I used for the web interface and the API. To prevent the deadlock we must remove `flock` and write the logs directly to the database `hosts_log` table. we may use the threads for inserting them (to avoid decreasing speed) and this part of `core/log.py` and do it while inserting logs in the database. we may use `scan_id` hash for selecting the logs and create the report log file too.

```python 
# this part must move into __log_into_file
if api_flag is 0:
        info(messages(language, 171))
    hosts = []
    for log in JSON_Data:
        if log[""HOST""] not in hosts:
            hosts.append(log[""HOST""])
    for host in hosts:
        for sm in scan_method.rsplit(','):
            remove_old_logs(host, sm, scan_id, language, api_flag)
    if api_flag is 0:
        info(messages(language, 170))
    for log in JSON_Data:
        submit_logs_to_db(language, api_flag, log)
```

`__log_into_file` also should be renamed to `__log_into_db`. and locate in `api.__database` [file](https://github.com/viraintel/OWASP-Nettacker/blob/master/api/__database.py).
let me know if anyone has time to work on this.

While running this framework on my machine (in MacOS) I've been notice that there is a different between running from ""Working Directory"" and from other Directories. 

I think its because the framework can't read (find) its own files when ""Working Directory"" & ""Location of Framework"" are different; and when framework run from directories which are NOT the working directory, it can't find its own files and causes this problem.

292214292,issue,closed,completed,prevent collision while writing logs,"Hello everyone,

While I was testing the frameworks, I notice that sometimes when the modules are writing the logs some collision happens.

```python
save = open(log_in_file, 'a')
save.write(
    json.dumps({'HOST': target, 'USERNAME': user, 'PASSWORD': passwd, 'PORT': port, 'TYPE': 'ssh_brute',

                'SCAN_ID': scan_id, 'SCAN_CMD': scan_cmd}) + '\n')
save.close()
```

it's best to add a function to the core and use it for locking the file and waiting for unlocking and replace all logging with this function.

sample function:
```python
def __log_to_file(filename, mode=""a"")
	while 1:
		if file not lock:
			lock the file
			write.filename.mode
			unlock the file
			break

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-01-28 16:07:42 UTC): Hello,

you have to create a function in `core/log.py`, inputs must be the filename, file writing mode (append[`a`], append-byte[`ab`], write[`w`], write-byte[`wb`]), content.

after getting the inputs you must check if the file is lock wait, and if it's not you may lock it (to prevent other processes open it) and write the content.

after that, each write functions should be fixed in the modules, e.g.: tcp_connect_port_scan module [line 128](https://github.com/viraintel/OWASP-Nettacker/blob/master/lib/scan/tcp_connect_port/engine.py#L128)

and it's done!

I think this solution might work: http://tilde.town/~cristo/file-locking-in-python.html
just note that `fcntl` is not available on windows! this might help too (need to be test first). https://pypi.python.org/pypi/portalocker

287778585,issue,closed,completed,A better target calculation,"Hello everyone,

When the framework starts, It starts processing on targets and calculate the number of them. (getting subdomains, IP ranges and etc). this process is in the `core/parse.py` by calling the `analysis` function from `core/targets.py`.

`core/parse.py`:

```python
    for total_targets, _ in enumerate(
            analysis(targets, check_ranges, check_subdomains, subs_temp, range_temp, log_in_file, time_sleep,
                     language, verbose_level, show_version, check_update, socks_proxy, retries)):
        pass
    total_targets += 1
    total_targets = total_targets * len(scan_method)
    targets = analysis(targets, check_ranges, check_subdomains, subs_temp, range_temp, log_in_file, time_sleep,
                       language, verbose_level, show_version, check_update, socks_proxy, retries)
```

as you see, first it's calculating the `total_targets` and then it's recalling the function **again** to get the targets.

I know it's wrong but It's working! I glad if someone provides a better method!

let me know if you have any question.

-m tcp_connect_port_scan
-m tcp_connect_port_scan,smtp_brute
-m tcp_connect_port_scan,ssh_brute,dir_scan

Just notice that, if anyone select anything, we must check if its not returning empty! (`*_blabla`) will return nothing!

you can develop it by adding a custom rule in `check_all_required`  in `load_all_args` function. this part:

What do you mean exactly by phpmyadmin scan ?
is it going to find the phpmyadmin by searching through directories for names ""like pma"" or ""phpmyadmin""? and after it found the service, detecting the version number and other stuffs ?

Yes, It should be like dir_scan (this module has a few more options) but
for detecting phpmyadmin only.

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-01-31 16:57:28 UTC): Hey,

`wappalyzer` is a framework to analysis HTTP response, (you can see the browser version by installing it on chrome/firefox...)

it's using some `JSON` library to detect the technologies using header and response body and it's awesome for information gathering.

* Github https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer
* js libs: https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/blob/master/src/

I also found a python version in here https://github.com/scrapinghub/wappalyzer-python
it's using the same library. you can get help from this tool.

please keep in mind to import JSON files in python module.

```
def extra_requirements_dict():
    return {
        ""lib_1"": {data....},
        ""lib_2"": {data....}
    }
```

let me know if you want more help.

if you have some troubles with creating new modules, please wait until the documents are ready and then you may ask questions.

Best Regards.

shaddygarg on (2018-03-06 16:08:46 UTC): Hey @Ali-Razmjoo,
I was looking for a way to implement the http-wappalyzer module. I saw the link to the repo(https://github.com/scrapinghub/wappalyzer-python) which you mentioned but I encountered some errors in setting it up. I have found a similar implementation in python ([link to the repo](https://github.com/chorsley/python-Wappalyzer/tree/master/Wappalyzer)). Can you look into it and see if I implement the scan module using this repo?

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-03-06 17:49:59 UTC): Hello,

I just introduce the repo to show a sample, I didn't mean to use any repo.

Regards.

mzfr on (2019-01-07 16:47:12 UTC): @Ali-Razmjoo Are there any other modules that are to be implemented, if yes then please let me know I would love to work on them.

securestep9 on (2020-06-10 16:02:34 UTC): all modules mentioned here (wappalyzer, brute forcing) got implemented - closing this issue

The framework already has `scan` and `brute` category. It's best if we can add more categories like `vuln` to check the vulnerabilities and exploits or `fuzz` to create some fuzzer or something! (I don't have ideas for fuzzers).

for the beginning, `heartbleed_vuln` or `ethernal_blue_vuln` would be great!

287670173,issue,closed,completed,A better multi threaded framework!,"Hello everyone.

Right now OWASP Nettacker has two kinds of multi-threading/processing. the first one is `-M` switch which is the number of hosts to scan together. It's using `multiprocessing` module. another one is the number of threads to a host `-t` switch. It's using the `threading` module.

the problem is when the threading number is too high, and we want to count the active threads! for example, check the `core/parse.py`.

```python
    for target in targets:
        for sm in scan_method:
            trying += 1
            p = multiprocessing.Process(target=start_attack, args=(
                str(target).rsplit()[0], trying, total_targets, sm, users, passwds, timeout_sec, thread_number,
                ports, log_in_file, time_sleep, language, verbose_level, show_version, check_update, socks_proxy,
                retries, ping_flag, methods_args))
            p.start()
            while 1:
                n = 0
                processes = multiprocessing.active_children()
                for process in processes:
                    if process.is_alive() is True:
                        n += 1
                    else:
                        processes.remove(process)
                if n >= thread_number_host:
                    time.sleep(0.01)
                else:
                    break
```

there is a for to check if the process is still alive and count it, otherwise remove the process from the array and if array length would be smaller than thread number, then add a new process.

or you can check one of the modules to see how the count with threading works.

```python
        for port in ports:
            port = int(port)
            t = threading.Thread(target=connect,
                                 args=(target, int(port), timeout_sec, log_in_file, language, time_sleep,
                                       thread_tmp_filename, socks_proxy))
            threads.append(t)
            t.start()
            trying += 1
            if verbose_level is not 0:
                info(messages(language, 72).format(trying, total_req, num, total, target, port))
            while 1:
                try:
                    n = 0
                    for thread in threads:
                        if thread.isAlive() is True:
                            n += 1
                        else:
                            threads.remove(thread)
                    if n >= max:
                        time.sleep(0.01)
                    else:
                        break
                except KeyboardInterrupt:
                    break
                    break
```
it's the same!

if set the thread number in `tcp_connect_port_scan` as 1000. it takes more than ""1 sec"" to check all the dead threads and add new threads. and if we remove the `time.sleep` the CPU usage will go high! So we need a better counting algorithm and thread control!

Let me know if there is any question!

Regards.

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-02-10 16:25:48 UTC): Hello,

there is a fundamental problem in multithreading in this framework. last night I push some [codes](https://github.com/viraintel/OWASP-Nettacker/tree/0c9147d248a1bf747d0ea5470a36c8455b058942) to enable an option if the user wants to use multi-threading instead of multiprocessing.

this is how the framework was working:
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7676267/36063615-5325fa50-0e94-11e8-9a28-954c46a9488d.jpg)

in the first view, it's fast! because it's using multi-core of CPU for scanning each target with each module.  in the real test, I scanned 20 IPs  `192.168.1.1-192.168.1.20` in 8.458 seconds with `1000` threads and `20` processes with `1000` default ports in no ping and TCP connect mode with 2 seconds timeout. that means `20* 1000 = 20,000` requests sent in 8.458 seconds. that's powerful!! but let's do it with `1` single port. I used the same IP range and it takes 5.997 seconds (almost 6 seconds) and it's just sent `20` requests. it's because of ""multiprocessing"". threads are faster than opening a new process.

new codes working like this:
![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7676267/36063948-0e7cca6e-0e99-11e8-86ed-e335efe9ce1b.jpg)

I've tried this 20 IPs with the single port with the [code](https://github.com/viraintel/OWASP-Nettacker/tree/0c9147d248a1bf747d0ea5470a36c8455b058942) I contributed last night it took only 3.335 seconds! (used one core of CPU (2% maybe))

I've also retest with `1000` default ports it took 14.553 seconds (used 100% of one core of CPU).  it's using threads instead of process. it's faster then we'd open more main threads for **short times**. 


but there were some issues that made me revert the codes I pushed.
* framework must know when we've to use threading or multiprocessing.
* when the framework uses multiprocessing, it's using max thread number in each module, that means we used `-t 1000` that means use `1000` threads for connecting to a host, but if you use `port_scan` and `ssh_brute`, it would let them create 1000 threads each!

after I pushed my codes in the master branch I released that
* codes are not working well on python 3
* codes will not be compatible if future to creating blocks in defined size, (I was using a class to keep thread numbers for each host in a `dict`, and then after we create new process we could not access the shared `dict`) 

so the whole master branch was WC and I revert the codes pushed to unfuck the situation. I created a `dev` branch for testing fundamentals commits.

what's best we need to do?
somehow we must estimate the time and usage of targets depend on selected modules and the requests they will make, then separate them to blocks (with defined size), open each block in a new process, and each process opens the threads.

if anyone would like to help on this one, I appreciate your ideas and contributions.

Best Regards.

Do you have any specific idea for a better HTML output ?
Don't you think that it is better that all kind of graphs having the same HTML output ?
I suggest `d3_tree_v1_graph,d3_tree_v2_graph` be like ` jit_circle_v1_graph ` . what do you think?

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-01-18 06:48:23 UTC): Hello,

I am like those HTML templates, so at the beginning, I just used those templates temporary to improved them later! As you can see in the issues (enhancements) we are working on new modules to provide a better scanner with more details, but due we are still in core optimization phase, we cannot develop modules much!

BTW, It's best to use the same HTML template that we want to use in explorer system #8. (something like ivre, censys or shodan).

let me know if you have any idea or you'd like to work on this.

Regards.

omdmhd on (2018-01-19 19:36:19 UTC): Hello,
Well,surely i like to work on this project . and doesn't matter which part  .
but if we are going to make something like [shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) or  [censys.io](https://censys.io/) . I think it is necessary to first create local database and then we improve the HTML template to be something like [censys.io](https://censys.io/) .
but I would do what you think is the best !

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-01-19 19:52:39 UTC): Hi @omdmhd ,

You are right about the local database should be the first, so it's best you work on other parts at the moment. (I'm working on API). it's best if someone could re-check language [libraries](https://github.com/viraintel/OWASP-Nettacker/tree/master/lib/language) and sync others with English library (even with the google translate).

I may recommend you to work on developing new module (even simple). Documents are available on the wiki.

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-07-12 15:02:47 UTC): @shaddygarg could you work on this as well?

shaddygarg (Assginee) on (2018-07-12 15:49:44 UTC): Sure Ali, I will have a look into it and will let you know if I find a better alternative and a better design.

securestep9 on (2020-06-10 15:59:44 UTC): Hey @Ali-Razmjoo  I believe this issue is outdated (2.5 years old) and can be closed now as HTML report is working fine?

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2021-02-01 13:40:44 UTC): it could be better tho but let's close this for now, we can have new design in next version.

I think it's great if the project has a `--wizard` switch for beginners. command lines maybe boring or complicated for newbie users. wizard switch may also have default values so if you just pushed the `enter`, the framework would set the default values. default values are saved in `config.py` in the main directory.

287665207,issue,closed,completed,OWASP Nettacker API,"Hello everyone,

OWASP Nettacker doesn't have any API at the moment so It's best to develop one! The purpose to design an API is that we can provide more user interfaces and controllers.

where are the events? all events that we'd show to users are using `core.alert` to print on the command line in one of these types: `info`, `warn`, `error`, `write`. also, every thread and events will save in the output file with `JSON` structure. output filename by default is like `results/results_date_random_chars.html` -> `results_2018_01_11_08_05_56_mkjiyjxklc.html` and it's stored in `log_in_file` variable in the framework (even if users change it with `-o` switch it's still in that variable).
example of a tcp_connect_port_scan event:
```
{
  ""USERNAME"": """",
  ""CATEGORY"": ""scan"",
  ""HOST"": ""127.0.0.1"",
  ""DESCRIPTION"": ""OPEN PORT"",
  ""TIME"": ""2018-01-11 11:47:05"",
  ""PASSWORD"": """",
  ""TYPE"": ""tcp_connect_port_scan"",
  ""PORT"": 1080
}
```
this `JSON` has 7 keys which are `HOST`, `PORT`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, `DESCRIPTION`, `CATEGORY`, `TIME`, `TYPE`. `TYPE` is the module name. I should notice that the keys are changing depend on the language, so if somone select Persian language, `HOST` will change to `هاست` and these replacements are available in `core/languages.py`.

```
{
  ""درگاه"": 1080,
  ""هاست"": ""127.0.0.1"",
  ""کلمه عبور"": """",
  ""دسته"": ""scan"",
  ""نوع"": ""tcp_connect_port_scan"",
  ""زمان"": ""2018-01-11 11:47:36"",
  ""نام کاربری"": """",
  ""توضیحات"": ""درگاه باز""
}
```

replacements:

```
_HOST = messages(language, 53)
_USERNAME = messages(language, 54)
_PASSWORD = messages(language, 55)
_PORT = messages(language, 56)
_TYPE = messages(language, 57)
_DESCRIPTION = messages(language, 58)
_TIME = messages(language, 115)
_CATEGORY = messages(language, 116)
```
to check the replacements you can open the `core/languages.py` and look for the keys. `_HOST` key is`53` so it's (default: ""en""):
```
{
  ""53"": {
    ""ru"": ""хозяин"",
    ""fr"": ""HÔTE"",
    ""en"": ""HOST"",
    ""nl"": ""HOST"",
    ""el"": ""ΠΛΗΘΟΣ"",
    ""vi"": ""HOST"",
    ""de"": ""GASTGEBER"",
    ""tr"": ""HOST"",
    ""ps"": ""HOST"",
    ""ur"": ""HOST"",
    ""fa"": ""هاست"",
    ""ja"": ""ホスト"",
    ""hi"": ""मेज़बान"",
    ""zh-cn"": ""主办"",
    ""ko"": ""숙주"",
    ""it"": ""OSPITE"",
    ""hy"": ""HOST"",
    ""ar"": ""مضيف"",
    ""id"": ""TUAN RUMAH"",
    ""es"": ""ANFITRIÓN""
  }
}
```

at the end, I should mention that the default language is always ""en"" except if a user changes it with command line or config file. the language value stores in `language` variable in the framework. if a value doesn't have any replacement in other languages, you may use `en`.

let me know if there is any question.

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2018-01-25 11:07:46 UTC): Hello,

API access log could be used with `--api-access-log` now and you can change filename with `--api-access-log-filename`. the default filename is `nettacker_api_access.log`.
* Sample log file

Can you let me know the features that are yet to be implemented in the API and if I could possibly work on some of them!
Regards.

Tikam02 on (2018-03-07 17:27:30 UTC): Hello,
Actually i want the same thing for the APIs frontend yet to be implemented as mentioned above by @shaddygarg  so we can  work on them.

the API is completed. I gonna update documents regarding this, then we can discuss the new ideas.

253186747,issue,closed,completed,Develop OWASP Nettacker Languages,"Hello everyone,

I just start creating messages in a [Python file](https://github.com/viraintel/OWASP-Nettacker/blob/master/core/languages.py) which is using JSON to keep the sentences. 

How should you add a new language? easy, just open the languages.py and start adding the messages. here it's an example.


Original:
```
 {
            ""0"": {
                ""en"": ""Nettacker engine started ...\n\n""
            },
            ""1"": {
                ""en"": ""python nettacker.py [options]""
            },
            ""2"": {
                ""en"": ""Nettacker Help Menu""
            },
...

           ""29"": {
                ""en"": ""set timeout to {0} seconds, it is too big, isn\""t it ? by the way we are continuing...""
            },
            ""30"": {
                ""en"": ""this scan module [{0}] not found!""
           },
...

```

after adding `Farsi/Persian` language:

```
 {
            ""0"": {
                ""en"": ""Nettacker engine started ...\n\n"",
                ""fa"": ""انجین Nettacker شروع به کار کرد ...\n\n""
            },
            ""1"": {
                ""en"": ""python nettacker.py [options]"",
                ""fa"": ""python nettacker.py [گزینه ها]""
            },
            ""2"": {
                ""en"": ""Nettacker Help Menu"",
                ""fa"": ""منو راهنمای Nettacker""
            },
...

           ""29"": {
                ""en"": ""set timeout to {0} seconds, it is too big, isn\""t it ? by the way we are continuing..."",
                ""fa"": ""مهلت بر روی {0} ثانیه تنظیم شد، خیلی زیاد است، نیست ؟ به هر حال ما ادامه خواهیم داد""
            },
            ""30"": {
                ""en"": ""this scan module [{0}] not found!"",
                ""fa"": ""این ماژول [{0}] پیدا نشد!""
           },
...
```

as you see, you need to add a cama `,` and then add your language and sentences.  

There is also a [wiki](https://github.com/viraintel/OWASP-Nettacker/wiki) that would be great if support multi languages.

I glad if anyone can help and make the PR. Persian (Farsi), Russian, Germany, French, Chinese, Vietnamese, Spanish, Indian (Hindi), Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, Ordo, Turkish. Dutch, are the most common, please try to work on them first.

@CodeMaxx I glad if you can give me some fixes for the Hindi language.
Thanks.

CodeMaxx on (2017-09-23 04:09:02 UTC): @Ali-Razmjoo My regional language is not Hindi so I don't know a lot about it, I'm sorry :/

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2017-09-23 07:42:06 UTC): @CodeMaxx thanks Akash.

Ali-Razmjoo (Issue Creator) on (2017-10-17 08:34:22 UTC): It's become about 20 (exactly 19) language which I think it's enough for now, I glad if anyone can fix the language grammars. Thanks.

psahithireddy on (2024-02-22 08:48:03 UTC): Hello, 
A few links aren't redirecting correctly. For example,
1) In `Home.md`, wiki and github links aren't redirecting correctly. 
2) Issues link in `Developers.md`
3) Missing _Issue Template_ and _PR Template_  in `Developers.md`.

I edited 1 and 2 on my end, but the wiki changes aren't detected in the fork in order to submit a PR.
