<h2>2.27.1 (2022-01-05)</h2>
<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed parsing issue that resulted in the <code>auth</code> component being
dropped from proxy URLs. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/6028"">#6028</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.27.0 (2022-01-03)</h2>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Officially added support for Python 3.10. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5928"">#5928</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a <code>requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError</code> to unify JSON exceptions between
Python 2 and 3. This gets raised in the <code>response.json()</code> method, and is
backwards compatible as it inherits from previously thrown exceptions.
Can be caught from <code>requests.exceptions.RequestException</code> as well. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5856"">#5856</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved error text for misnamed <code>InvalidSchema</code> and <code>MissingSchema</code>
exceptions. This is a temporary fix until exceptions can be renamed
(Schema-&gt;Scheme). (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/6017"">#6017</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved proxy parsing for proxy URLs missing a scheme. This will address
recent changes to <code>urlparse</code> in Python 3.9+. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5917"">#5917</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed defect in <code>extract_zipped_paths</code> which could result in an infinite loop
for some paths. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5851"">#5851</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed handling for <code>AttributeError</code> when calculating length of files obtained
by <code>Tarfile.extractfile()</code>. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5239"">#5239</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping <code>urllib3.exceptions.InvalidHeader</code> with
<code>requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader</code>. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5914"">#5914</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed bug where two Host headers were sent for chunked requests. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5391"">#5391</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed regression in Requests 2.26.0 where <code>Proxy-Authorization</code> was
incorrectly stripped from all requests sent with <code>Session.send</code>. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5924"">#5924</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed performance regression in 2.26.0 for hosts with a large number of
proxies available in the environment. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5924"">#5924</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed idna exception leak, wrapping <code>UnicodeError</code> with
<code>requests.exceptions.InvalidURL</code> for URLs with a leading dot (.) in the
domain. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5414"">#5414</a>)</p>

<h2>v1.22.0</h2>
<h1>NumPy 1.22.0 Release Notes</h1>
<p>NumPy 1.22.0 is a big release featuring the work of 153 contributors
spread over 609 pull requests. There have been many improvements,
highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotations of the main namespace are essentially complete. Upstream
is a moving target, so there will likely be further improvements,
but the major work is done. This is probably the most user visible
enhancement in this release.</li>
<li>A preliminary version of the proposed Array-API is provided. This is
a step in creating a standard collection of functions that can be
used across application such as CuPy and JAX.</li>
<li>NumPy now has a DLPack backend. DLPack provides a common interchange
format for array (tensor) data.</li>
<li>New methods for <code>quantile</code>, <code>percentile</code>, and related functions. The
new methods provide a complete set of the methods commonly found in
the literature.</li>
<li>A new configurable allocator for use by downstream projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are in addition to the ongoing work to provide SIMD support for
commonly used functions, improvements to F2PY, and better documentation.</p>
<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.8-3.10, Python 3.7
has been dropped. Note that 32 bit wheels are only provided for Python
3.8 and 3.9 on Windows, all other wheels are 64 bits on account of
Ubuntu, Fedora, and other Linux distributions dropping 32 bit support.
All 64 bit wheels are also linked with 64 bit integer OpenBLAS, which should fix
the occasional problems encountered by folks using truly huge arrays.</p>
<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>
<h3>Deprecated numeric style dtype strings have been removed</h3>
<p>Using the strings <code>&quot;Bytes0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Datetime64&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Str0&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;Uint32&quot;</code>,
and <code>&quot;Uint64&quot;</code> as a dtype will now raise a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>
<p>(<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19539"">gh-19539</a>)</p>
<h3>Expired deprecations for <code>loads</code>, <code>ndfromtxt</code>, and <code>mafromtxt</code> in npyio</h3>
<p><code>numpy.loads</code> was deprecated in v1.15, with the recommendation that
users use <code>pickle.loads</code> instead. <code>ndfromtxt</code> and <code>mafromtxt</code> were both
deprecated in v1.17 - users should use <code>numpy.genfromtxt</code> instead with
the appropriate value for the <code>usemask</code> parameter.</p>

1071324465,pull_request,closed,,auto service discovery,"Hi,

I implemented a similar feature we used to have in version 0.0.2 to ignore a port and send requests, e.g., HTTP if the port is not accepting the first request. this will save us a lot of time during a scan. For example, if a host doesn't have port 80 open, it won't keep trying and failing until the loop is finished. So instead, it will ignore the payload(if it's HTTP) (or any other payload such as ssh or whatever).

There is also a new feature if it discovers a known service (such as HTTP) in service discovery and our protocol exists in the framework. It will automatically rewrite and enforce the port and scan that service with relevant payloads. For instance, if there is an HTTP service on port 5000, and default HTTP ports are set as 80 and 443, it will automatically add 5000 (and remove 80 and 443 if they are not open). This also added a lot of value in saving time and benefits us during scans.

This service is relayed on port_scan, which means all targets will be automatically port_scan unless you use the `--skip-service-discovery` switch.

If a service didn't recognize during port_scan (HTTP signature was unknown), it would not be scanned, which pushes us to improve our signature-based service scan in the future.

During service discovery or `--ping-before-scan`, if you choose `port_scan` or `icmp_scan` module, they will be ignored as scan modules because we will use them in service discovery you will see the results in the reports anyway.

This also means if you want to check for an exploit on port 8080, you don't have to enter `-g 8080`, once the target port has been discovered, it will be automatically rewriting the ports in the modules, if you face issues with the discovery, use `--skip-service-discovery -g 8080` to enforce the scan.

@securestep9 @aman566 @itsdivyanshjain  please give this a review and test if you have time. It got a bit complicated and might cause a bug.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Bests, Ali.

<h2>v1.21.4</h2>
<h1>NumPy 1.21.4 Release Notes</h1>
<p>The NumPy 1.21.4 is a maintenance release that fixes a few bugs
discovered after 1.21.3. The most important fix here is a fix for the
NumPy header files to make them work for both x86_64 and M1 hardware
when included in the Mac universal2 wheels. Previously, the header files
only worked for M1 and this caused problems for folks building x86_64
extensions. This problem was not seen before Python 3.10 because there
were thin wheels for x86_64 that had precedence. This release also
provides thin x86_64 Mac wheels for Python 3.10.</p>
<p>The Python versions supported in this release are 3.7-3.10. If you want
to compile your own version using gcc-11, you will need to use gcc-11.2+
to avoid problems.</p>

<h2>v1.21.2</h2>
<h1>NumPy 1.21.2 Release Notes</h1>
<p>The NumPy 1.21.2 is maintenance release that fixes bugs discovered after
1.21.1. It also provides 64 bit manylinux Python 3.10.0rc1 wheels for
downstream testing. Note that Python 3.10 is not yet final. There is
also preliminary support for Windows on ARM64 builds, but there is no
OpenBLAS for that platform and no wheels are available.</p>
<p>The Python versions supported for this release are 3.7-3.9. The 1.21.x
series is compatible with Python 3.10.0rc1 and Python 3.10 will be
officially supported after it is released. The previous problems with
gcc-11.1 have been fixed by gcc-11.2, check your version if you are
using gcc-11.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2>2.26.0 (2021-07-13)</h2>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Requests now supports Brotli compression, if either the <code>brotli</code> or
<code>brotlicffi</code> package is installed. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5783"">#5783</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Session.send</code> now correctly resolves proxy configurations from both
the Session and Request. Behavior now matches <code>Session.request</code>. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5681"">#5681</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a race condition in zip extraction when using Requests in parallel
from zip archive. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5707"">#5707</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dependencies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instead of <code>chardet</code>, use the MIT-licensed <code>charset_normalizer</code> for Python3
to remove license ambiguity for projects bundling requests. If <code>chardet</code>
is already installed on your machine it will be used instead of <code>charset_normalizer</code>
to keep backwards compatibility. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5797"">#5797</a>)</p>
<p>You can also install <code>chardet</code> while installing requests by
specifying <code>[use_chardet_on_py3]</code> extra as follows:</p>
<pre lang=""shell""><code>pip install &quot;requests[use_chardet_on_py3]&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Python2 still depends upon the <code>chardet</code> module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requests now supports <code>idna</code> 3.x on Python 3. <code>idna</code> 2.x will continue to
be used on Python 2 installations. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5711"">#5711</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deprecations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>requests[security]</code> extra has been converted to a no-op install.
PyOpenSSL is no longer the recommended secure option for Requests. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5867"">#5867</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.5. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5867"">#5867</a>)</p>
</li>

<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/master/HISTORY.md"">requests's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>2.26.0 (2021-07-13)</h2>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Requests now supports Brotli compression, if either the <code>brotli</code> or
<code>brotlicffi</code> package is installed. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5783"">#5783</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Session.send</code> now correctly resolves proxy configurations from both
the Session and Request. Behavior now matches <code>Session.request</code>. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5681"">#5681</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a race condition in zip extraction when using Requests in parallel
from zip archive. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5707"">#5707</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dependencies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instead of <code>chardet</code>, use the MIT-licensed <code>charset_normalizer</code> for Python3
to remove license ambiguity for projects bundling requests. If <code>chardet</code>
is already installed on your machine it will be used instead of <code>charset_normalizer</code>
to keep backwards compatibility. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5797"">#5797</a>)</p>
<p>You can also install <code>chardet</code> while installing requests by
specifying <code>[use_chardet_on_py3]</code> extra as follows:</p>
<pre lang=""shell""><code>pip install &quot;requests[use_chardet_on_py3]&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Python2 still depends upon the <code>chardet</code> module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requests now supports <code>idna</code> 3.x on Python 3. <code>idna</code> 2.x will continue to
be used on Python 2 installations. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5711"">#5711</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deprecations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>requests[security]</code> extra has been converted to a no-op install.
PyOpenSSL is no longer the recommended secure option for Requests. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5867"">#5867</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.5. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5867"">#5867</a>)</p>
</li>

<blockquote>
<h1>Version 2.0.1</h1>
<p>Released 2021-05-21</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-add the <code>filename</code> parameter in <code>send_from_directory</code>. The <code>filename</code> parameter has been renamed to <code>path</code>, the old name is deprecated. 4019</li>
<li>Mark top-level names as exported so type checking understands imports in user projects. 4024</li>
<li>Fix type annotation for <code>g</code> and inform mypy that it is a namespace object that has arbitrary attributes. 4020</li>
<li>Fix some types that weren't available in Python 3.6.0. 4040</li>
<li>Improve typing for <code>send_file</code>, <code>send_from_directory</code>, and <code>get_send_file_max_age</code>. 4044, 4026</li>
<li>Show an error when a blueprint name contains a dot. The <code>.</code> has special meaning, it is used to separate (nested) blueprint names and the endpoint name. 4041</li>
<li>Combine URL prefixes when nesting blueprints that were created with a <code>url_prefix</code> value. 4037</li>
<li>Roll back a change to the order that URL matching was done. The URL is again matched after the session is loaded, so the session is available in custom URL converters. 4053</li>
<li>Re-add deprecated <code>Config.from_json</code>, which was accidentally removed early. 4078</li>
<li>Improve typing for some functions using <code>Callable</code> in their type signatures, focusing on decorator factories. 4060</li>
<li>Nested blueprints are registered with their dotted name. This allows different blueprints with the same name to be nested at different locations. 4069</li>
<li><code>register_blueprint</code> takes a <code>name</code> option to change the (pre-dotted) name the blueprint is registered with. This allows the same blueprint to be registered multiple times with unique names for <code>url_for</code>. Registering the same blueprint with the same name multiple times is deprecated. 1091</li>
<li>Improve typing for <code>stream_with_context</code>. 4052</li>
</ul>
<h1>Version 2.0.0</h1>
<p>Released 2021-05-11</p>
<ul>
<li>Drop support for Python 2 and 3.5.</li>
<li>Bump minimum versions of other Pallets projects: Werkzeug &gt;= 2, Jinja2 &gt;= 3, MarkupSafe &gt;= 2, ItsDangerous &gt;= 2, Click &gt;= 8. Be sure to check the change logs for each project. For better compatibility with other applications (e.g. Celery) that still require Click 7, there is no hard dependency on Click 8 yet, but using Click 7 will trigger a DeprecationWarning and Flask 2.1 will depend on Click 8.</li>
<li>JSON support no longer uses simplejson. To use another JSON module, override <code>app.json_encoder</code> and <code>json_decoder</code>. 3555</li>
<li>The <code>encoding</code> option to JSON functions is deprecated. 3562</li>
<li>Passing <code>script_info</code> to app factory functions is deprecated. This was not portable outside the <code>flask</code> command. Use <code>click.get_current_context().obj</code> if it's needed. 3552</li>
<li>The CLI shows better error messages when the app failed to load when looking up commands. 2741</li>
<li>Add sessions.SessionInterface.get_cookie_name to allow setting the session cookie name dynamically. 3369</li>
<li>Add Config.from_file to load config using arbitrary file loaders, such as <code>toml.load</code> or <code>json.load</code>. Config.from_json is deprecated in favor of this. 3398</li>
<li>The <code>flask run</code> command will only defer errors on reload. Errors present during the initial call will cause the server to exit with the traceback immediately. 3431</li>
<li>send_file raises a ValueError when passed an io object in text mode. Previously, it would respond with 200 OK and an empty file. 3358</li>
<li>When using ad-hoc certificates, check for the cryptography library instead of PyOpenSSL. 3492</li>
<li>When specifying a factory function with <code>FLASK_APP</code>, keyword argument can be passed. 3553</li>
<li>When loading a <code>.env</code> or <code>.flaskenv</code> file, the current working directory is no longer changed to the location of the file. 3560</li>
<li>When returning a <code>(response, headers)</code> tuple from a view, the headers replace rather than extend existing headers on the response. For example, this allows setting the <code>Content-Type</code> for <code>jsonify()</code>. Use <code>response.headers.extend()</code> if extending is desired. 3628</li>
<li>The <code>Scaffold</code> class provides a common API for the <code>Flask</code> and <code>Blueprint</code> classes. <code>Blueprint</code> information is stored in attributes just like <code>Flask</code>, rather than opaque lambda functions. This is intended to improve consistency and maintainability. 3215</li>
<li>Include <code>samesite</code> and <code>secure</code> options when removing the session cookie. 3726</li>
<li>Support passing a <code>pathlib.Path</code> to <code>static_folder</code>. 3579</li>
<li><code>send_file</code> and <code>send_from_directory</code> are wrappers around the implementations in <code>werkzeug.utils</code>. 3828</li>
<li>Some <code>send_file</code> parameters have been renamed, the old names are deprecated. <code>attachment_filename</code> is renamed to <code>download_name</code>. <code>cache_timeout</code> is renamed to <code>max_age</code>. <code>add_etags</code> is renamed to <code>etag</code>. 3828, 3883</li>
<li><code>send_file</code> passes <code>download_name</code> even if <code>as_attachment=False</code> by using <code>Content-Disposition: inline</code>. 3828</li>
<li><code>send_file</code> sets <code>conditional=True</code> and <code>max_age=None</code> by default. <code>Cache-Control</code> is set to <code>no-cache</code> if <code>max_age</code> is not set, otherwise <code>public</code>. This tells browsers to validate conditional requests instead of using a timed cache. 3828</li>
<li><code>helpers.safe_join</code> is deprecated. Use <code>werkzeug.utils.safe_join</code> instead. 3828</li>
<li>The request context does route matching before opening the session. This could allow a session interface to change behavior based on <code>request.endpoint</code>. 3776</li>
<li>Use Jinja's implementation of the <code>|tojson</code> filter. 3881</li>
<li>Add route decorators for common HTTP methods. For example, <code>@app.post(&quot;/login&quot;)</code> is a shortcut for <code>@app.route(&quot;/login&quot;, methods=[&quot;POST&quot;])</code>. 3907</li>
<li>Support async views, error handlers, before and after request, and teardown functions. 3412</li>

<blockquote>
<h1>Version 2.0.0</h1>
<p>Released 2021-05-11</p>
<ul>
<li>Drop support for Python 2 and 3.5.</li>
<li>Bump minimum versions of other Pallets projects: Werkzeug &gt;= 2, Jinja2 &gt;= 3, MarkupSafe &gt;= 2, ItsDangerous &gt;= 2, Click &gt;= 8. Be sure to check the change logs for each project. For better compatibility with other applications (e.g. Celery) that still require Click 7, there is no hard dependency on Click 8 yet, but using Click 7 will trigger a DeprecationWarning and Flask 2.1 will depend on Click 8.</li>
<li>JSON support no longer uses simplejson. To use another JSON module, override <code>app.json_encoder</code> and <code>json_decoder</code>. 3555</li>
<li>The <code>encoding</code> option to JSON functions is deprecated. 3562</li>
<li>Passing <code>script_info</code> to app factory functions is deprecated. This was not portable outside the <code>flask</code> command. Use <code>click.get_current_context().obj</code> if it's needed. 3552</li>
<li>The CLI shows better error messages when the app failed to load when looking up commands. 2741</li>
<li>Add sessions.SessionInterface.get_cookie_name to allow setting the session cookie name dynamically. 3369</li>
<li>Add Config.from_file to load config using arbitrary file loaders, such as <code>toml.load</code> or <code>json.load</code>. Config.from_json is deprecated in favor of this. 3398</li>
<li>The <code>flask run</code> command will only defer errors on reload. Errors present during the initial call will cause the server to exit with the traceback immediately. 3431</li>
<li>send_file raises a ValueError when passed an io object in text mode. Previously, it would respond with 200 OK and an empty file. 3358</li>
<li>When using ad-hoc certificates, check for the cryptography library instead of PyOpenSSL. 3492</li>
<li>When specifying a factory function with <code>FLASK_APP</code>, keyword argument can be passed. 3553</li>
<li>When loading a <code>.env</code> or <code>.flaskenv</code> file, the current working directory is no longer changed to the location of the file. 3560</li>
<li>When returning a <code>(response, headers)</code> tuple from a view, the headers replace rather than extend existing headers on the response. For example, this allows setting the <code>Content-Type</code> for <code>jsonify()</code>. Use <code>response.headers.extend()</code> if extending is desired. 3628</li>
<li>The <code>Scaffold</code> class provides a common API for the <code>Flask</code> and <code>Blueprint</code> classes. <code>Blueprint</code> information is stored in attributes just like <code>Flask</code>, rather than opaque lambda functions. This is intended to improve consistency and maintainability. 3215</li>
<li>Include <code>samesite</code> and <code>secure</code> options when removing the session cookie. 3726</li>
<li>Support passing a <code>pathlib.Path</code> to <code>static_folder</code>. 3579</li>
<li><code>send_file</code> and <code>send_from_directory</code> are wrappers around the implementations in <code>werkzeug.utils</code>. 3828</li>
<li>Some <code>send_file</code> parameters have been renamed, the old names are deprecated. <code>attachment_filename</code> is renamed to <code>download_name</code>. <code>cache_timeout</code> is renamed to <code>max_age</code>. <code>add_etags</code> is renamed to <code>etag</code>. 3828, 3883</li>
<li><code>send_file</code> passes <code>download_name</code> even if <code>as_attachment=False</code> by using <code>Content-Disposition: inline</code>. 3828</li>
<li><code>send_file</code> sets <code>conditional=True</code> and <code>max_age=None</code> by default. <code>Cache-Control</code> is set to <code>no-cache</code> if <code>max_age</code> is not set, otherwise <code>public</code>. This tells browsers to validate conditional requests instead of using a timed cache. 3828</li>
<li><code>helpers.safe_join</code> is deprecated. Use <code>werkzeug.utils.safe_join</code> instead. 3828</li>
<li>The request context does route matching before opening the session. This could allow a session interface to change behavior based on <code>request.endpoint</code>. 3776</li>
<li>Use Jinja's implementation of the <code>|tojson</code> filter. 3881</li>
<li>Add route decorators for common HTTP methods. For example, <code>@app.post(&quot;/login&quot;)</code> is a shortcut for <code>@app.route(&quot;/login&quot;, methods=[&quot;POST&quot;])</code>. 3907</li>
<li>Support async views, error handlers, before and after request, and teardown functions. 3412</li>
<li>Support nesting blueprints. 593, 1548, 3923</li>
<li>Set the default encoding to &quot;UTF-8&quot; when loading <code>.env</code> and <code>.flaskenv</code> files to allow to use non-ASCII characters. 3931</li>
<li><code>flask shell</code> sets up tab and history completion like the default <code>python</code> shell if <code>readline</code> is installed. 3941</li>
<li><code>helpers.total_seconds()</code> is deprecated. Use <code>timedelta.total_seconds()</code> instead. 3962</li>
<li>Add type hinting. 3973.</li>
</ul>

871161015,pull_request,closed,,Upgrade to GitHub-native Dependabot,"_Dependabot Preview will be shut down on August 3rd, 2021. In order to keep getting Dependabot updates, please merge this PR and migrate to GitHub-native Dependabot before then._

Dependabot has been fully integrated into GitHub, so you no longer have to install and manage a separate app. This pull request migrates your configuration from Dependabot.com to a config file, using the [new syntax][new_syntax]. When merged, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!

With this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub][dependabot_page], rather than the [Dependabot dashboard][dashboard], to monitor your version updates, and you'll configure Dependabot through the new config file rather than a UI.

Your previous schedule was set to `live`. This option is no longer supported in the new config file so it has been changed to `daily`.






If you've got any questions or feedback for us, please let us know by creating an issue in the [dependabot/dependabot-core][issues] repository.

#### Changes proposed in this pull request
This pull request contains the implementation of a new icmp library which provides an option to run ping as non-root user as specified in #49 . As I mentioned in the issue, icmplib is compatible only with python3.6+, if necessary I could modify the pull request to check for python version and decide on which code to use.

following code is been used in every start function of the module which leads to Duplication of code

```
      if target_type(target) != 'SINGLE_IPv4' or target_type(target) != 'DOMAIN' or target_type(target) != 'HTTP':
              # requirements check
              new_extra_requirements = extra_requirements_dict()
              if methods_args is not None:

                      if extra_requirement in methods_args:

              warn(messages(language, ""input_target_error"").format(
                  'module_name', target))

```

we can use decorators `e.g: @requirements_check(target_to_host=True,scan_name='xss_vuln')` for that and
Also we can use socks proxy decorator as per #187.

<h2>Release: 0.8.0</h2>
<p>Date: 3 Jul 2020</p>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Changes since 0.7.20
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed weak reference support in classes with <code>__slots__</code></li>
<li>Added <code>__bytes__</code> to <code>IPAddress</code> for intuitive usage, thanks to Michael Belousov.</li>
<li>Added <code>format()</code> function to EUI, thanks to Omer Anson.</li>
<li>Added <code>IPNetwork.netmask</code> property setter, thanks to Naveen Nathan.</li>
<li>Added support for IABs in the <code>40:D8:55</code> OUI, thanks to Brian Maissy.</li>
<li>Drastically optimized <code>spanning_cidr()</code>, thanks to Brian Maissy.</li>
<li>Fixed <code>&quot;x.x.x.x/x&quot; in IPNetwork</code> tests, thanks to xpac1985.</li>
<li>Added support for passing iterables of <code>IPRange</code> to <code>IPSet</code> and <code>cidr_merge()</code>, based
on a patch by Henry Stern.</li>
</ul>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specific bug fixes addressed in this release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>FIXED Issue 205: <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/netaddr/netaddr/issues/205"">netaddr/netaddr#205</a>
- N log N complexity instead of linear</p>
<p>FIXED Issue 171: <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/netaddr/netaddr/issues/171"">netaddr/netaddr#171</a>
- Efficiently creating a large IPSet from a list of IPRanges?</p>
<p>FIXED Issue 161: <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/netaddr/netaddr/issues/161"">netaddr/netaddr#161</a>
- Weak reference support</p>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^
Miscellanea
^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<ul>
<li>The next release (0.9.0) will contain a backwards incompatible change in IPNetwork's behaviour.
It's connected to handling of RFC 6164 IPv6 addresses (/127 and /128): IPNetwork.broadcast will
return None for those and first addresses in the networks will no longer be excluded when
iterating IPNetwork and IPNetwork.iter_hosts(). See <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/netaddr/netaddr/pull/168"">netaddr/netaddr#168</a>
(or temporarily reverted commit 2984c0a40a70 in this repository) to see the actual patch.</li>

<h2>Release: 0.7.20</h2>
<p>Date: 19 Jun 2020</p>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Changes since 0.7.19
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed returning from an iterator on Python 3.7+, by Sergey Kozlov.</li>
<li>Fixed Python 3.8 SyntaxWarning on using <code>is not</code> with a string literal, by Stefan Nordhausen.</li>
<li>Fixed DeprecationWarnings by using raw strings for escape characters used in regexes, by Sean McGinnis.</li>
<li>Improved IPGlob documentation, by obkmeta.</li>
<li>Fixed exception creation in corner cases by explicitly passin error message params as tuples, by
Matthias Urlichs.</li>
<li>Stopped manually replacing shebang of an included script.</li>
<li>Stopped using <strong>file</strong> in all code that's expected to run in environments that don't support it
(like PyOxidizer-produced binaries).</li>
<li>Updated all databases included in the package.</li>
</ul>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specific bug fixes addressed in this release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>FIXED Issue 182: <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/netaddr/netaddr/issues/182"">netaddr/netaddr#182</a>
- test_ip_splitter_remove_prefix_larger_than_input_range fails with python 3.7</p>
<p>FIXED Issue 206: <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/netaddr/netaddr/issues/206"">netaddr/netaddr#206</a>
- &quot;&quot;is not&quot; with a literal.&quot; SyntaxWarning</p>
<p>FIXED Issue 198: <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/netaddr/netaddr/issues/198"">netaddr/netaddr#198</a>
- oui databases are outdated</p>
<p>FIXED Issue 188: <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/netaddr/netaddr/issues/188"">netaddr/netaddr#188</a>
- Avoid use of <strong>file</strong></p>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^
Miscellanea
^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 2 versions older than 2.7 and Python 3 versions older than 3.5 should be considered
unsupported. No incompatible code has been introduced to the best of our knowledge but
there's no CI infrastructure in place to verify this and if there are any issues with
those versions they won't be fixed.</li>
<li>Consequently, Python 2.7 and 3.5 support should be considered deprecated as 2.7 has
reached its end-of-life already and 3.5 will hit it soon.</li>
<li>A CI setup has been introduced which allows us to test on a variety of Python versions
on all Mac, Linux and Windows.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.24.0 (2020-06-17)</h2>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>pyOpenSSL TLS implementation is now only used if Python
either doesn't have an <code>ssl</code> module or doesn't support
SNI. Previously pyOpenSSL was unconditionally used if available.
This applies even if pyOpenSSL is installed via the
<code>requests[security]</code> extra (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5443"">#5443</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redirect resolution should now only occur when
<code>allow_redirects</code> is True. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5492"">#5492</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No longer perform unnecessary Content-Length calculation for
requests that won't use it. (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/psf/requests/issues/5496"">#5496</a>)</p>

1. **python nettacker.py -i pintasuper.com -m shodan_scan --method-args ""shodan_api_key=XXX&shodan_query_override=country:in port:6443""**
In this example the nettacker will find all the open kubernetes services in india.
2. If no shodan_query_override is given in the --method-args option then shodan will run on **-i** switch's target. For ex:
**python nettacker.py -i pintasuper.com -m shodan_scan --method-args ""shodan_api_key=XXX""**
In this case shodan will run on pintasuper.com
3. It will work in case of CIDR too. as the internal process of nettacker divides the CIDR to ip range and iterate on it. So shodan will give it's results according to the CIDR entered. Ex:
**python nettacker.py -i 10.0.0.0/8 -m shodan_scan --method-args ""shodan_api_key=XXX&shodan_query_override=country:in port:8080**"" will search for all tomacat servers running in india in the CIDR range of 10.0.0.0/8.

The results in nettacker will vary according to the given API(Different shodan API plans will differ the results in nettacker).

Note: **shodan_api_key** and **shodan_query_override** are to be given to the tool for proper shodan working.

- [X] Added the pma.py in the lib/scan/pma module to imporve the codebase.
- [X] Modified the following files where the useragents, usernames, passwords file is imported from lib/payload/wordlists/ library:
        1. Username, password in the files - all modules in brute library: ftp, http_basic_auth, http_form, http_ntlm, smtp, ssh, telnet, wp_xmlrpc.
        2. Useragents in the files - http_fuzzer/engine.py, admin, cms_detection, dir, pma, wp_plugin, wp_theme, wp_timthumbs, citrix_cve_2019_19781, wordpress_dos_cve_2018_6389 modules in the scan library.
- [X] Added ports.py in lib/scan/port module and remove unused imports from scapy for clean code.
- [X] fixed a version import bug in the lib/scan/admin, lib/scan/dir, lib/scan/wp_timethumbs module.

Results:
The directory listing is improved and I tested on some websites and it gives much better output now. pma_scan works only with python2.x not with python3.x due to some issues in http_fuzzer library.

615405862,pull_request,closed,,Changed XML-RPC brute to make tool fast,"The current wp_xmlrpc_brute module was doing the direct brute force on the web application with very weak wordlist files. So To be honest, without doing the brute force what we can do make tool faster is just check that xmlrpc is enable or not. This can be achieved using two techniques:
1. Seeing the response to the request  : http://domain/xmlrpc.php and the response should contain the string: ""XML-RPC server accepts POST requests only.""
2. But the second is more accurate: Making an actual post request and see the response which tells which requests we can make using xml.
So what I did is I just changed the code to make sure that it gives the faster response by just telling the web is vulnerable to xmlrpc or not. This will help pentester in many aspects:
1. He has to input this command to test for xmlrpc:
`python3 nettacker.py -m wp_xmlrpc_brute -i domain.com
`
2. After our tool confirms that the web is vulnerable, he can immideately go to burp suite and start intruder for brute forcing with **better username, password list.** This will save his time.
I just tried and it took much time so I decieded to do this.
The results are:

<li>The <code>flask.json_available</code> flag was added back for compatibility with some extensions. It will raise a deprecation warning when used, and will be removed in version 2.0.0. 3288</li>
</ul>
<h1>Version 1.1.0</h1>
<p>Released 2019-07-04</p>
<ul>
<li>Bump minimum Werkzeug version to &gt;= 0.15.</li>
<li>Drop support for Python 3.4.</li>
<li>Error handlers for <code>InternalServerError</code> or <code>500</code> will always be passed an instance of <code>InternalServerError</code>. If they are invoked due to an unhandled exception, that original exception is now available as <code>e.original_exception</code> rather than being passed directly to the handler. The same is true if the handler is for the base <code>HTTPException</code>. This makes error handler behavior more consistent. 3266
<ul>
<li>Flask.finalize_request is called for all unhandled exceptions even if there is no <code>500</code> error handler.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flask.logger takes the same name as Flask.name (the value passed as <code>Flask(import_name)</code>. This reverts 1.0's behavior of always logging to <code>&quot;flask.app&quot;</code>, in order to support multiple apps in the same process. A warning will be shown if old configuration is detected that needs to be moved. 2866</li>
<li>flask.RequestContext.copy includes the current session object in the request context copy. This prevents <code>session</code> pointing to an out-of-date object. 2935</li>
<li>Using built-in RequestContext, unprintable Unicode characters in Host header will result in a HTTP 400 response and not HTTP 500 as previously. 2994</li>
<li>send_file supports ~os.PathLike objects as described in PEP 0519, to support pathlib in Python 3. 3059</li>
<li>send_file supports ~io.BytesIO partial content. 2957</li>
<li>open_resource accepts the &quot;rt&quot; file mode. This still does the same thing as &quot;r&quot;. 3163</li>
<li>The MethodView.methods attribute set in a base class is used by subclasses. 3138</li>
<li>Flask.jinja_options is a <code>dict</code> instead of an <code>ImmutableDict</code> to allow easier configuration. Changes must still be made before creating the environment. 3190</li>
<li>Flask's <code>JSONMixin</code> for the request and response wrappers was moved into Werkzeug. Use Werkzeug's version with Flask-specific support. This bumps the Werkzeug dependency to &gt;= 0.15. 3125</li>
<li>The <code>flask</code> command entry point is simplified to take advantage of Werkzeug 0.15's better reloader support. This bumps the Werkzeug dependency to &gt;= 0.15. 3022</li>
<li>Support <code>static_url_path</code> that ends with a forward slash. 3134</li>
<li>Support empty <code>static_folder</code> without requiring setting an empty <code>static_url_path</code> as well. 3124</li>
<li>jsonify supports dataclasses.dataclass objects. 3195</li>
<li>Allow customizing the Flask.url_map_class used for routing. 3069</li>
<li>The development server port can be set to 0, which tells the OS to pick an available port. 2926</li>
<li>The return value from cli.load_dotenv is more consistent with the documentation. It will return <code>False</code> if python-dotenv is not installed, or if the given path isn't a file. 2937</li>
<li>Signaling support has a stub for the <code>connect_via</code> method when the Blinker library is not installed. 3208</li>
<li>Add an <code>--extra-files</code> option to the <code>flask run</code> CLI command to specify extra files that will trigger the reloader on change. 2897</li>
<li>Allow returning a dictionary from a view function. Similar to how returning a string will produce a <code>text/html</code> response, returning a dict will call <code>jsonify</code> to produce a <code>application/json</code> response. 3111</li>
<li>Blueprints have a <code>cli</code> Click group like <code>app.cli</code>. CLI commands registered with a blueprint will be available as a group under the <code>flask</code> command. 1357.</li>
<li>When using the test client as a context manager (<code>with client:</code>), all preserved request contexts are popped when the block exits, ensuring nested contexts are cleaned up correctly. 3157</li>
<li>Show a better error message when the view return type is not supported. 3214</li>
<li><code>flask.testing.make_test_environ_builder()</code> has been deprecated in favour of a new class <code>flask.testing.EnvironBuilder</code>. 3232</li>
<li>The <code>flask run</code> command no longer fails if Python is not built with SSL support. Using the <code>--cert</code> option will show an appropriate error message. 3211</li>
<li>URL matching now occurs after the request context is pushed, rather than when it's created. This allows custom URL converters to access the app and request contexts, such as to query a database for an id. 3088</li>

<p><em>Sourced from The GitHub Security Advisory Database.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Moderate severity vulnerability that affects requests</strong>
The Requests package through 2.19.1 before 2018-09-14 for Python sends an HTTP Authorization header to an http URI upon receiving a same-hostname https-to-http redirect, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover credentials by sniffing the network.</p>

itsdivyanshjain on (2021-04-24 04:39:51 UTC): @securestep9 
I think it is important to have all the conditions in https_cors module. @aman566 can you use nettacker logging function instead of using print function.

aman566 (Issue Creator) on (2021-04-24 04:49:05 UTC): Hello @itsdivyanshjain can you please mention which all cases I am missing.
About the logging function, I will change it for sure :)

itsdivyanshjain on (2021-04-24 05:53:25 UTC): @aman566 i am referring to @securestep9 that currently master branch has very few condition for cors and this PR is important to merge because you mentioned mostly all the condition.

 I have noticed now that you have implemented all the important conditions but still have not mentioned some condition like unrecognized underscore, thirdparty allowed.

you can refer this https://github.com/s0md3v/Corsy for all the conditions.

Ali-Razmjoo on (2021-09-09 20:37:05 UTC): this can't be supported anymore. modules are yaml #440

- [x] I have added the relevant documentation.
- [x] My branch is up-to-date with the Upstream master branch.

#### Changes proposed in this pull request
This PR addresses the following issues:
- [x] A missing parenthesis bug (#220).
- [x] Resolves an erring import from `requests` `InsecureRequestWarning`.
- [x] Resolving dependencies between Python2 and Python3 libraries (#222, #223)

#### Additional Information
- This PR address #222 by switching back to pure Python instead of using libraries which cause conflict and problematic backward-compatibility between the two versions.
- `requirements.txt` of this framework marks `requests==2.19.1` as a requirement. However `attack.py` under `core/` uses an outdated version to suppress `InsecureRequestWarning`. This PR addresses the issue by correctly switching the suppress statement to the `urllib3` library.

shaddygarg on (2020-03-02 17:27:04 UTC): @Ali-Razmjoo, do we want to do this kind of thing when we already support custom wordlists and all? I am not sure about the usage of it.

aman566 (Issue Creator) on (2020-03-02 17:51:16 UTC): @shaddygarg Sir the custom wordlist is not sufficient. This wordlist will give larger attack surface. Please check and let me know for any issues :)

Ali-Razmjoo on (2020-03-02 20:12:57 UTC): it's always good to have a bigger wordlist, but we don't keep such a thing in the tool since we have this feature.

```
  --method-args METHODS_ARGS
                        enter methods inputs, example: ftp_brute_users=test,ad
                        min&ftp_brute_passwds=read_from_file:/tmp/pass.txt&ftp
                        _brute_port=21
```

you can simply add `--method-args dir_scan_list=read_from_file:/tmp/directories.txt` and load your files. I think it's unnecessary, and that short array is just default values from modules...

aman566 (Issue Creator) on (2020-03-03 01:01:36 UTC): Totally agreeing with you but we can have it as a default wordlist, meaning if someone don't want to have its own that nettacker will search with this one :). Any suggestions?

aman566 (Issue Creator) on (2020-05-15 11:52:20 UTC): Closing this PR for clean commit history, as fixed in #272

- [ ] I have added the relevant documentation. (I don't have access to modify it)

#### Changes proposed in this pull request
- I have switched to alpine instead of using ubuntu image.
- Added some enhancements like removing the development packages after finishing the installation.
- Used combination of `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` so it will be easier to run commands by passing the arguments directly like below instead of typing the whole command:
```
docker run -it --rm owasp-nettacker:latest -i 127.0.0.1 --profile information_gathering
```
- This PR closes #188 

- I have tried to use python 3.7 image which is `python:alpine` but the project dependencies do not support it. for example py3DNS library gives the following:
```

#### Changes proposed in this pull request
Issue : #187 
This PR adds the feature of using `socks_proxy` template as a python decorator. The steps to use this are as follows : 
1. Importing : `from core.decor import socks_proxy`
2. Put `@socks_proxy` over every function that you wish to decorate. 

As per my best knowledge of the project architecture I have put `decor.py` in the `core` folder. Moreover `decor.py` can be further extended to include multi-threading decorator, for which I wish to open a separate issue. This will save contributors from rewriting long codes every time rather than just focusing on the core concept, rest being handled by decorators.

#### Changes proposed in this pull request
Issue : #135 

There were a few code duplication in `lib/http_fuzzer/engine.py`, thus violating the DRY principle. This PR deals with those issues.
`timeout_sec` is by default set to `None`. We need not need to create a separate `if-else` regarding this. We can pass `timeout=timeout_sec` provided `timeout=None` is a valid parameter.

We can generate the request statement dynamically by using `eval` function, this will reduce chances of repeating ourselves.

I think it's better if we develop it using the database to check for the update just once in a day, not more, except if the user runs the command to check! looking forward to knowing your idea about this.

updates: please create a new table and name it `options`, then add three columns (`option_name` (string type), `option_value` (string type), `last_modify` (time and date type)) and implement the first option based on sqlalchemy and add `check_for_update` option.

to add this, insert a `check_for_update` in `option_name`, `message_id` (which it using the last version or not from language library based on last checked) in `option_value` and the time of insert as `last_modify`.

startup check for update function must check if the `last_modify` is older than 24 hours ago, it must check for the update and update the `message_id` and `last_modify` otherwise just skip the function. let me know if you have farther questions.

Regards.

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-06-25 12:54:24 UTC): any thoughts? @pradeepjairamani @shaddygarg

shaddygarg on (2018-06-25 13:35:07 UTC): I think it is a good idea to do this!!

pradeepjairamani (Issue Creator) on (2018-06-27 07:30:16 UTC): That is a good idea..

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-06-27 12:30:42 UTC): so @pradeepjairamani please work on this one.

pradeepjairamani (Issue Creator) on (2018-06-27 12:32:39 UTC): I tried doing the timeout thing using request but It didn't worked. Let me see if I can find anything else

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-06-27 14:35:42 UTC): do you mean this?! working fine for me! 
```python
In [25]: def a(timeout):
    ...:     try:
    ...:         requests.get(""http://api.z3r0d4y.com:810/"", timeout=timeout)
    ...:     except:
    ...:         pass
    ...:

In [26]: %time a(None)
Wall time: 42.2 s

In [27]: %time a(1)
Wall time: 2 s

In [28]: %time a(3)
Wall time: 6 s
```

anyway after setting the timeout, if you implement the database thing it would be not a problem, 42sec in 24 hours will not count as anything :D! 

Regards.

  {""SERVICE_NAME_2"": [""SIGNATURE_1""]}

 (e.g.)
  {""HTTP"": [""Server:"", ""Content-Length:"", ""Content-Type:"", ""HTTP/1.1""]}
]
```

then we can use a `for` loop to detect the possible service.
```python
n = 0
for service_name in services_names:
    FLAG = True
    for signature in service_names[n][service_name]:
        if signature not in response: # we are checking if all signatures are available in response not one of them!
            FLAG = False
    if FLAG:
         info(""fice service {0}"".format(service_name), event={xyz...}) # use messages() lib
    n += 1
```

can you please explain me the logic of using global for closed_port variable?

I am going to update engine.py to remove this.

pradeepjairamani on (2018-04-23 09:32:14 UTC): Hello,

If it is important to use  closed_port globally, you can also use
`closed_port = int()`

Best Regards

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-04-23 09:32:56 UTC): @VictorSuraj, Great,

To be sure, please patch the possible bug.

```python
def check_closed(ip):
    for i in range(1, 10):
        s = sr1(IP(dst=ip) / TCP(dport=i), timeout=2, verbose=0)
        if s != 'SA' and s != None: #if this never happen, function will return None
            return i
```
if in any case, the conditions do not pass the `if`, the function never `return i`. so it's best to add `return 0` in end of function to prevent possible errors.

Regards.

VictorSuraj (Issue Creator) on (2018-04-23 09:35:59 UTC): I review it, ""global closed_port"" is used inside function filter_port(ip,port).
I think it well used here. If ""global closed_port"" remove from function ""filter_port( ip,port)"" then outputs remains same.
So I think we should remove ""global closed_port"".

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-04-23 09:38:49 UTC): @VictorSuraj, yes, it's not necessary so you should remove it.

shaddygarg on (2018-04-23 09:40:12 UTC): Hey,
There are four empty lines between two functions : https://github.com/zdresearch/OWASP-Nettacker/pull/112/files#diff-ce3bf9d902408140b4d7678a6395911bR131. You should make them two instead of four.
Regards.

VictorSuraj (Issue Creator) on (2018-04-23 09:42:02 UTC): @Ali-Razmjoo 
No error comes out also in that rare  case if any server's initial ten ports open.
because   here our code check any closed port in initial ten port if any port is closed then it will return 
the port_number.

VictorSuraj (Issue Creator) on (2018-04-23 09:46:17 UTC): I think we should change as a return 0 in the end if a rare case caused as ten initial port opened in a server 
then it will return None or 0.

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-04-23 09:48:29 UTC): @VictorSuraj, so please add `return 0` for the rare cases, also as @shaddygarg mentioned, please use PEP8 style (I can modify your code but it's best to use pycharm or sublime),

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-04-19 14:59:24 UTC): Hey,

I recently added the automated code coverage sending to codacy, the environment variable `CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN` exist already and I've sent some commits, that's weird! let me check to find the problem.

BTW, shouldn't we use the latest version of the modules instead of defining the version? what's your point?

Regards.

pradeepjairamani (Issue Creator) on (2018-04-19 19:00:21 UTC): Hello,

If there is a previously installed version of any library in python, it doesn't update that library and says requirement already satisfied but when we give it version information it fetches that version even if that module is present.
An example is shown in the image
![screenshot_18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24669027/39012056-f4a1426e-4430-11e8-89f7-a5e8d1d686d2.png)

On top of that, we can install pyup which will update the requirements.txt with the latest version of modules and create a pull request on its own
[pyup](https://pyup.io/)

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-04-19 19:54:10 UTC): Hey,

Pyup is commercial for organizations, I think if users use `--upgrade` switch it will be installing the latest version, but it's some kind better for virtualenv, so let's merge it!

Regards.

pradeepjairamani (Issue Creator) on (2018-04-19 19:58:37 UTC): Hello,

I have installed and tested pyup for the fork of Nettacker and it is free for public repositories, we can implement it.
A screenshot of the same is attached.

Best Regards

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-04-19 20:36:28 UTC): Hey,

maybe you can monitor it and send the PR, but because it's on your github ""user"" not organization, you can use pyup for free.

Regards.

$ python nettacker.py -i https://offsecresearch.com/ -m port_scan

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-04-21 21:19:11 UTC): as I commented (I am not sure you are seeing), please rename the ""filter"" function to fix the issue.

Thanks for your contribution, a few changes need to be more handy with the framework.

* relocate the generator with `lib/payload/password_generator/engine.py` (use `engine.py` like other modules) and create its own `readme.md` file.
* do not use any `raw_input` or `input`, I should maintain the automating process in the framework for the reason.
* `generate(""file.txt"")` or `generate(None)` could be optimized. e.g. if user need to create a file it could be `generate(filename=""file.txt"")` otherwise `generate()` could return an array with passwords. in this case, you may modify the module like this. `def generate(filename=None):`. later we can add other methods to generate the password. e.g
```python
def generate(filename=None, common=None, suffix=False, prefix=False, username=None):
# generate common passwords
# generate with the suffix
# generate with the prefix
# generate depend on the username (e.g. username=""Ali"", output: [""Ali1"", ""Ali123"", ""Ali123!"", ""Ali!@#"", ""Ali2018""])
```
* if you need to `print` something, please use `core.alert` 
* use `core.log.__log_into_file(filename, mode, data, language, final=True)` for writing files (notice: use `final=True`)
* apply PEP8 fix the lib
* do not forget to add `__init__.py` to the lib folder.
* add code based docuemntation.
* add the document into your readme (like you did) I will add them to wiki

#1 I should probably write these roles in the documents too.

Best Regards.

pradeepjairamani (Issue Creator) on (2018-03-29 16:54:21 UTC): Ok, I will make the changes and
Please give me a little tip for taking input without input or raw_input
secondly there is no need for the username as in the data is already being generated from user specified details like name, last name, email, etc.

Best Regards

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-03-29 17:46:37 UTC): Hi,
* Please give me a little tip for taking input without input or raw_input
you may use default values and create an input method for changing the defaults.

* secondly there is no need for the username as in the data is already being generated from user specified details like name, last name, email, etc.

my bad, I think using the default (like I said) would solve this.

let me know if you have any more questions.

Regards.

pradeepjairamani (Issue Creator) on (2018-03-29 17:58:40 UTC): My password list generator takes input from the user for generating password list like first name, last name, dob, email, phone number, vehicle number for generating the password list for the user.
There will be no use of creating a module for generating password list which would end up with default values always, we can get a file from the internet for that

Best Regards
Pradeep Jairamani

Ali-Razmjoo on (2018-03-29 18:10:56 UTC): could the function work like `def generate(username=""razmjoo"", phone_number="""", birth_year="""", email="""", name=""ali"", last_name=""razmjoo"", etc..)`  ?

It's due to the default behaviour of open in Python 3. By default, Python 3 will open files in Text mode, which means that it also has to apply a text decoding, such as utf-8 or ASCII, for every character it reads.

Python will use your locale to determine the most suitable encoding. On OS X and Linux, this is usually UTF-8. On Windows, it'll use an 8-bit character set, such windows-1252, to match the behaviour of Notepad.

so i added encoding with open. this fixed the error.

I believe the new function is working wrong. I've two questions regarding this.
* why you are using `write_blocks` array and appending the file name in it without using it anywhere else?
* should `flock = lockfile.FileLock(filename)` be inside the `if` ? i've tested it outside the if, framework is working fine!
```
def __log_into_file(filename, mode, data):

    if filename not in write_blocks:
        write_blocks.append(filename)
        flock = lockfile.FileLock(filename)

    flock.acquire()
    with open(filename, mode) as save:
        save.write(data + '\n')
    flock.release()
```
