2755288380,pull_request,closed,,fix: Stock Entry uses incorrect company when generated from Pick List (backport #44679) (backport #44681),"Corrects the problem where the Stock Record associated with the Separation List uses the incorrect company.
The change ensures that the Stock Record uses the company of the original Material Requisition.
Steps to Reproduce
1 Create a Material Requisition of type ""Material Transfer"" for a specific company code (e.g. ""Company2"").
2 Create a Picking List from the Requisition.
3 Generate a Stock Entry from the Picking List.
4 Verify that the company code associated with the Stock Entry does not match the company code of the original Requisition (""Company2"").
Issue Location
The issue is likely located in the pick_list.py file (lines 865-878) of the ""erpnext.stock.doctype.pick_list"". module.
Proposed Solution
To fix this issue, it is suggested to change the line stock_entry.company = pick_list.get(""company"") to get the correct company code from the original Material Requisition.

Could you post replication steps or the scenario where Account Closing Balance creation is missed? This might need some rigorous testing.

ljain112 on (2024-12-30 11:10:17 UTC): Steps to replicate:

- Switch to v15.39.6 
- Create an Expense Account.
- Create a Journal Entry for the Expense.
- Create PCV for the fiscal year.
- Again Create a Journal Entry for expense with the same account.
- Again Create PCV.
- Switch to version 15 latest.

In version 15, the Account closing balance for the expense account will be incorrect because the closing balance will be as per only the first PCV.

New Logic:

- change GL references of all PCVs in the period to be that of the first created (or last created) PCV for the period.
- mark all PCVs except the first created as cancelled.
- Recalculate account closing balance.

Note: There is still the (rare) chance that the closing account head can be different. but it won't lead to big repercussions because (only the GLs won't match with what's written in doc, one can cancel and re-submit if they really want that consistency)

ruthra-kumar (Assginee) on (2025-01-06 09:19:45 UTC): This is replicable on develop.

Simpler replication:
1. Make a Journal Entry on expense account on Q1 of a Fiscal Year.
2. Close Q1 using PCV
3. Make another Journal on Q1
4. Close Q2

Steps to replicate:
- Create a tax withholding category with period 1-10-2024 to 31-3-2025.
- Create a Supplier with a tax withholding category.
- Create a Lower Deduction Certification for the supplier,valid from 1-4-2024  and valid up to 31-3-2025.
- Even though LDC is valid and within the period, it will not be applied due to incorrect date filters.

Solution:
Validating LDC based on inv date.

2748076919,pull_request,closed,,feat(subcontracting): Added provision to create multiple Subcontracting Orders against a single Purchase Order (backport #44711),"Made changes to fulfil issue #43986 

Current flow: Only a single Subcontracting Order could be made against a Subcontracted Purchase Order

New flow: User can now create multiple Subcontracting Orders against a single Purchase Order

1. Checks for existing Subcontracting Order has been removed
2. Upon creating a new Subcontracting Order, a new check has been added which will throw and error if user is trying to create a new SO against a PO which has been fully subcontracted

How to use: When creating a Subcontracting Order, user now has the ability to change the quantity of finished good item, hence enabling them to create a SO which partly fulfils the corresponding PO

Notes:

1. An error will be thrown if quantity entered is higher than available subcontracting quantity (fetched from the PO)
2. Upon creating a new Subcontracted Order, the line items will by default have the quantity as the remaining/available quantity to subcontract

### Root cause of Issue

In PR #44320, if enough stock is not available, the error message shows `Stock UOM` instead of `UOM` to get accurate stock details.

Arguments for creating a new item row when selecting:

https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/6f99e9959d06c60cf2c59f7aee46d675cd8d3b50/erpnext/selling/page/point_of_sale/pos_controller.js#L577

These args does not have `stock_uom`.
