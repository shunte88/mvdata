**Before:** 

https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/41591 I know the `refresh_fields` method slows down the entry, but the totals and taxes are not calculated when the quantity and rate are changed.

this PR covers issue: https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/issues/41752

Before this PR the resolving of dunnings counted just with last status of overdue_payments. If the last status was ""Resolved"" (for example last Sales Invoice was paid) the parent Dunning was ""Resolved"". It didn't take care about status of previous overdue_payments.

Next change:

Set the condition for the delivery trip so that a completed Delivery Challan (DC) will not appear. Also, add the customer filter in the ""Get stops from"".

The `docstatus` 1 was removed from the delivery trip due to https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/38559, but `docstatus` 1 is still set in `delivery_note.js`, which is confusing because it is set in one place but not in another.

Currently, I haven't made any changes related to `docstatus`, but if you request, I will also update it in `delivery_note.js`.

**Output:**
