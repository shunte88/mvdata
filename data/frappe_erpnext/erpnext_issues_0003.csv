2732684456,issue,open,,Payment Schedule rows removed when creating a Credit Note from an Invoice - Missing E-Invoicing data,"### Information about bug

**Issue Description:**

**Version Details:**  
- ERPNext: v15 (Commit: 925eb44)  
- Frappe version: 15.50.0

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Create an invoice with a valid Payment Schedule (child table) configured for e-invoicing.  
2. Generate a Credit Note (Credit Note = Nota di Credito) directly from that invoice.  
3. Observe that upon creating the Credit Note, the Payment Schedule child table rows are removed.

**Expected Behavior:**  
The Payment Schedule rows should remain intact, ensuring that the necessary information for e-invoicing XML generation is available in the Credit Note.

**Actual Behavior:**  
The Payment Schedule entries are deleted from the Credit Note, resulting in the following error when attempting to generate the XML for e-invoicing:  
“E-Invoicing Information Missing. Please set the Payment Schedule from the regional module for Italy.”

**Impact:**  
Without these Payment Schedule rows, the system fails to generate the required e-invoicing XML data, blocking the proper issuance of the Credit Note in compliance with Italian e-invoicing regulations.

**Additional Details:**  
- The issue occurs even when using a clean environment without any customizations.  
- Screenshots and logs can be provided upon request.

Please investigate this issue, as it prevents proper e-invoicing for Credit Notes derived from Invoices.

For return invoices payment terms are not supported.

dinoweb (Issue Creator) on (2024-12-12 09:28:43 UTC): I understand the current behavior, but due to Italian electronic invoicing requirements, the Payment Schedule is still needed for return invoices (credit notes). The official ERPNext regional module for Italy enforces this check and raises an error if payment terms are missing. As a temporary workaround, I’ve implemented a `doc_events` hook on the `validate` action that copies the Payment Schedule and Payment Terms Template from the original invoice back into the credit note:

```python
import frappe

def get_original_invoice(doc):
    if doc.return_against:
        return frappe.get_doc(""Sales Invoice"", doc.return_against)
    return None

def execute(doc, method=None):
    if doc.is_return:
        original_invoice = get_original_invoice(doc)
        if original_invoice and original_invoice.payment_schedule:
            for payment_schedule in original_invoice.payment_schedule:
                # Reset references so that rows can be appended properly
                payment_schedule.name = None
                payment_schedule.parent = None
                doc.append(""payment_schedule"", payment_schedule)
        doc.payment_terms_template = original_invoice.payment_terms_template
```

This ensures that the mandatory payment information required for Italian e-invoicing is retained. It’s not an ideal long-term solution, but it works until an official fix or more appropriate handling is introduced into ERPNext.

diptanilsaha (Assginee) on (2025-01-19 08:05:06 UTC): @dinoweb please share screenshots.

vorasmit on (2025-01-22 11:58:54 UTC): @dinoweb,

Is Payment Schedule really mandatory for e-Invoice in Italy (especially for sales return)?

We refer to following XSD and can check that minimum occurrences for tag `DatiPagamento` is zero, meaning it’s not mandatory
https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/export/documenti/fatturapa/v1.2.1/Schema_del_file_xml_FatturaPA_versione_1.2.xsd

Also, the implementation here suggests it's optional
https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/develop/erpnext/regional/italy/e-invoice.xml#L217

Once you confirm this, we’ll better know what fix is needed for this.

dinoweb (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-22 13:22:12 UTC): Thank you for your interest.

Although the documentation seems to suggest that the Payment Schedule is
optional, the interchange system managed by the state has rejected all
credit notes that did not include it. So yes, in my opinion, it is a
mandatory piece of information.

Thank you for your work!

2724862119,issue,open,,Recording User Actions and Generating Macros for Automation,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

ERPNext lacks a built-in feature for recording user actions in the system and converting these actions into reusable macros or scripts. Such functionality could significantly enhance user productivity by automating repetitive tasks and simplifying complex workflows. Similar capabilities exist in enterprise-grade systems like SAP (e.g., SAP GUI Scripting, Transaction Recorder (SHDB)), and implementing this in ERPNext would provide users with advanced tools for process automation.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Develop a User Action Recorder module in ERPNext that:
	1.	Records User Actions:
	        •	Tracks and logs user interactions within the system, such as form submissions, button clicks, field updates, and navigation.
	        •	Captures these actions in a structured, exportable format.
	2.	Generates Reusable Macros or Scripts:
	        •	Transforms recorded actions into a script (e.g., Python or JavaScript), compatible with ERPNext’s API and automation tools.
	        •	Allows users to save and edit the scripts for customization.
	3.	Supports Execution and Automation:
	        •	Enables replaying recorded macros for automating repetitive tasks.
	        •	Integrates with existing Server Scripts and Custom Scripts in ERPNext for extending functionality.
	4.	User Interface:
	        •	Provides a simple UI to start/stop recording, view recorded actions, and export/import scripts.
	        •	Offers integration with ERPNext’s workflow automation.

2723997411,issue,open,,Streamlining Shipment Cost Allocation in ERPNext: Addressing Operational Inefficiencies and Control Challenges (landed cost voucher),"Workflow for Handling Freight Expenses and Customs Duty in ERP, as Explained by Umair Sayed
Key Methodology:
•	When adding freight expenses or custom duty, ensure it is applied to valuation only. This ensures the additional expense is added to the item’s valuation without creating a liability against the foreign supplier.
•	For additional expenses added through a Landed Cost Voucher (LCV):
o	The system automatically debits the Stock-in-Hand account and credits the Expense Included in Valuation account.
o	The credited account is located under the Direct Expense > Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS) group.
Example Accounting Entries:
1.	Valuation Adjustment for Freight/Customs:
Debit  Stock-in-Hand                        $1,000
Credit Expense Included in Valuation        $1,000
2.	At the Point of Item Delivery or Consumption:
Debit  Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS)            $1,000
Credit Stock-in-Hand                        $1,000
Impact:
This process ensures that:
•	Freight/custom duty expenses directly contribute to the item's valuation.
•	CoGS reflects the true purchase value of items without manual reconciliation.
•	A separate purchase invoice can be created for freight/custom expenses to record liability in the appropriate expense accounts.
________________________________________
Identified Cons of This Approach:
While the methodology ensures accounting accuracy, it introduces several operational and control challenges:
1.	Excessive Steps and Time Wastage:
o	The process requires multiple steps, which can be streamlined if such details were stored in a master table at the database level rather than being manipulated in individual transactions.
2.	Risk of User Manipulation:
o	Allowing users to modify tax fields at the purchase invoice level introduces risks:
	Errors due to manual entry.
	Fraud from intentional manipulation of tax or customs rates.
o	Tax regulations should ideally be fixed and immutable at the system level.
3.	Inadequate Control Over Customs Rates:
o	Users can set custom rates arbitrarily, even if these rates are not confirmed by the supply chain department. This undermines control and accuracy.
4.	Contradiction with Strategic Policies:
o	General policy controls, such as customs and tax rates, are delegated to individual users. This contradicts the strategic intent of centralized control and standardized practices.
5.	Limitations in Handling Item-Specific Rates:
o	Different items on the same purchase invoice cannot have distinct customs or duties rates since the process applies adjustments at the invoice level rather than the item level. This makes it impossible to accurately handle diverse rates for multiple items.
6.	Liability Tracking Challenges:
o	While valuation adjustment entries handle stock and expense accounts, there is no clear mechanism to reflect liabilities (e.g., to DHL or a freight forwarder) in the supplier account without creating a separate purchase invoice.

The way other efficient ERPs handles this workflow:

Workflow and Settings for Handling Foreign Purchases with Shipment Expenses in ERPs as per Nexgen Business solutions
Scenario:

Managing foreign purchases with shipment expenses, including costs from customs and freight forwarders (e.g., DHL).
________________________________________
Accounting Entries
1. Shipment Expenses Entry:
Prerequisites:
•	Types of Shipment Expense Valuation:
o	At the account level, define valuation methods for shipment expenses (e.g., by value, weight, or volume) if the account is related to shipment costs.
•	Stock Master and Item Screen:
o	Ensure the duties and customs percentage is fixed in the item screen. This percentage serves as a reference for each transaction. It cannot be manipulated without proper access permissions.
•	Landed Cost Voucher or Journal Entry:
o	A field to link the shipment code must exist.
•	Purchase Receipt/Invoice Screen:
o	A field to link the shipment code must exist.
•	Cost Calculation:
o	The system aggregates all expenses associated with the same shipment code and adds them to the Stock-in-Hand account value.
Accounting Entry:
Debit  Shipment Expenses Account      $1,000
Credit Supplier Account DHL              $1,000________________________________________
2. Cost Calculation for Purchase Receipt/Invoice (if Shipment Expenses are Involved):
Accounting Entry:
Credit Shipment Expenses (or any Expense Counter Account)   $1,000
Debit  Inventory-in-Hand                                      $1,000________________________________________
3.At the Point of Item Delivery or Consumption:
Debit  Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS)            $1,000
Credit Stock-in-Hand                        $1,000
Process Summary:
1.	Record shipment expenses using the shipment code.
2.	Use the Landed Cost Voucher or appropriate journal entry to link and allocate shipment expenses.
3.	Calculate the cost for purchase receipts/invoices by:
o	Consolidating shipment expenses using the shipment code.
o	Adjusting the inventory value based on the calculated landed cost.
________________________________________
This structure ensures clarity, compliance with accounting standards, and proper cost allocation in the ERP system. Let me know if you need further refinements!

Proposed Feature Development:

1.	Centralized Rate Management:
o	Introduce a master table for customs and freight rates, linked to item and supplier records. This ensures consistency, reduces manual intervention, and improves data integrity.
2.	Fixed Tax and Customs Fields:
o	Lock tax and customs rates at the master level, allowing only authorized personnel to update them as per regulatory changes. This reduces fraud risk and ensures compliance.
3.	Support for Item-Level Rate Allocation:
o	Enable landed cost allocation at the item level to handle diverse rates for multiple items in a single purchase transaction.
4.	Automated Liability Tracking:
o	Enhance the system to automatically generate liability entries for freight forwarders or customs agents when landed costs are processed, eliminating the need for separate manual invoices.
5.	Simplified Workflow:
o	Consolidate steps in the landed cost workflow to reduce complexity and enhance efficiency.
________________________________________
Impact of Feature Development
•	Efficiency: Streamlining the process will save time and reduce workload for users.
•	Accuracy: Centralizing rates and automating liability tracking will minimize errors.
•	Compliance: Locking critical fields ensures adherence to tax and customs regulations.
•	Flexibility: Item-level rate allocation enables more accurate cost management for diverse products.

2718667499,issue,closed,completed,Debit and Credit Mismatch in Payment Entry (ERPNext V14),"### Information about bug

Summary: 
Submitting a Payment Entry where an employee is the party results in a debit-credit mismatch in the General Ledger. The GL posting logic doubles the posted amount, causing an imbalance error.

Affected Versions: ERPNext V14 (confirmed); not reproducible in V15.

Steps to Reproduce:
Create a Payment Entry where the party is an employee.
Submit the Payment Entry.
Observe the error: ""Debit and Credit not equal for Payment Entry #XXXX. Difference is XXXX.""

Root Cause:
Likely due to duplicated or incorrect GL entries in make_gl_entries or save_entries logic.

Solution: Fix GL posting logic to ensure debit and credit amounts match for Payment Entries. This issue is already resolved in V15.

2713979058,issue,open,,Add FSSAI License fields to Company DocType for Indian compliance,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, there is no dedicated field to store and display FSSAI License details in the Company DocType's registration details section. FSSAI License number is a mandatory requirement for food businesses in India and needs to be displayed on various business documents and reports. Having to manually add this information each time or store it in custom fields creates inconsistency and additional work.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add the following fields under Company DocType > Print Settings > Registration Details section:

FSSAI License Number (Data type: Data)
FSSAI License Valid From (Data type: Date)
FSSAI License Valid Until (Data type: Date)

These fields should:

Be available for printing on standard documents like Sales Invoice, Purchase Order, etc.
Include validation for the standard FSSAI license number format
Show a warning when the license is about to expire (30 days before expiry)

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

Using Custom Fields - While this works, it doesn't provide a standardized solution across installations

2711697370,issue,open,,Total of the O/s Invoices at the Paid Total Field at the Payment Entry.,"We are not getting the Total of the O/s Invoices at the Paid Total

Actually in case of Multiple Bills Invoice, system should auto fetch and refresh and calculate the amount by default in the “Paid Total” after selecting O/s Invoices from the O/s Invoices Table. Here we are calculating manually which is a cumbersome process and chances of error also , and in case we need to change the amount we should be able to get and hence “Paid Amount” should get calculate automatically by adding the sum total of all the O/s Invoices.

This would be a generic requirement and it should inbuilt in the system

We have raised the Ticket-26484 against which your Support Executive

Hello,

We understand the requirement you mentioned and appreciate your detailed explanation. At the moment, the system does not support the feature where the paid amount can dynamically adjust based on outstanding invoices, as the payment can also be made in advance. This makes it challenging to establish a logic for automatic calculation tied solely to outstanding invoices.

We recommend raising this as a Feature Request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&template=feature_request.md&title=) so our team can review it and consider it for future development. This ensures that your feedback is directly shared with the product team and helps prioritize features based on user needs

We cannot provide any timelines on the FRs as they will be taken up for development based on the development bandwidth and product feature roadmap.

2709917106,issue,closed,completed,"Quickbooks Migrator ""Failed"" from Quickbooks Online Essentials (Canada) to ERPNext v15 self hosted on Ubuntu 24.04","### Information about bug

All the customer and vendor information transferred over fine.   Once it gets into transferring invoices, journal entries, and all other transactions it goes to ""Failed"".  I read some places that the fiscal year might have something to do with incomplete transfers.  I'm happy that at least all customer and vendor information transferred but I have some suggestions for that, and in general for this to be suitable for a business to migrate.

1 - for Customer Data: If there is a first and last name field with the customer record, this should be created as a contact as well, and all phone numbers/email addresses should be added to both the customer record, and individual contact person record associated with the customer record.  

2 - All previous fiscal years invoices, quotes, and basically all information held in QuickBooks should import over.  As a business owner we require all of the previous information on file to better serve customers.  The ""incomplete"" aka ""failed"" transfer creates all kinds of additional book keeping costs for having to review what transferred and what didn't and then everything has to be corrected and/or double checked.    It keeps us stuck in QuickBooks until all previous records for at least the last 7 years can transfer over.

If the above two items are resolved I think it would help significantly increase migration numbers.   It's something we need resolved urgently.

First of all, why is it site1.localhost? Not just site1.local?

Next, it seems to be running:

Next, the log file is not under $HOME as stated in the doc. It is in the frappe install directory.

This is the content of the log:

2697292435,issue,closed,completed,Server Script it't not working,"### Information about bug

I'm experiencing an issue where server scripts are not executing as expected in ERPNext v15. Specifically, I've created a simple server script that is intended to run on the Customer doctype with the After Insert event, but the script doesn't appear to trigger at all. I've verified the script setup and also attempted different document types and events, but none seem to work.

Environment:

ERPNext Version: 15.43.3
Frappe Version: v15.48.1

Steps to Reproduce:

Go to Settings > Server Script and create a new server script.
Script Type: Document Event
Reference Document Type: Customer
Event: After Insert

Script:
python
Copy code
```
def create_project_and_tasks(doc, method):
    frappe.log_error(title=""Server Script Trigger Test"", message=f""Server script has been triggered for the document: {doc.name}"")
    frappe.throw(""Server script triggered successfully."")
```
Save the script and ensure it is Active.
Create a new Customer from the Customer doctype.
Expected Behavior:

When a new customer is created, the server script should:
Log an entry in the Error Log with the title ""Server Script Trigger Test"".
Raise an error saying ""Server script triggered successfully.""

Actual Behavior:

No log entries are created in the Error Log.
No pop-up error is displayed after saving the customer.
It appears that the server script is not being triggered at all.
Additional Details:

I have verified that the server script feature is enabled in the site_config.json with ""server_script_enabled"": true.
I have also tried other document types (e.g., Sales Order) and different events (Before Insert, Before Save).
Client scripts are working fine, and I can confirm that client-side execution triggers as expected.
I tried restarting the bench and verified that the script is active and permissions are appropriate, but still no luck.
No relevant logs or errors appear in the Error Log or in the bench console when running the server script.

Steps Taken for Troubleshooting:

Restarted ERPNext services using bench restart.
Ensured that the server script feature is enabled.
Tested on different doctypes and events.
Verified user permissions and logged in as an administrator.
Monitored the bench console but didn't observe any related errors or logs.

2697076184,issue,closed,completed,`current_invoice_start` is wrong,"### Information about bug

Step to reproduce:

1. Create a new subscription with trial period and the current date need to be in the trial period. And choose `start_date` after the `trial_end`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e854491e-e639-4a6a-bcc4-8b6c999d3381)

2. Save.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d995cd53-a857-466d-a4ca-2b172c7844e4)

As you can see, the `current_invoice_start` is `trial_period_start` which is wrong and should be the `start_date`.

So,

2694370496,issue,closed,completed,Project template : expected dates not copied when creating project,"### Information about bug

I have set up some (template) tasks in Project Template, and I planned all the scheduling (start and end dates) in template tasks.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/494610d2-4f30-4a57-a79c-fd3d56471999)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22971da3-df38-4dcc-946a-5bd1bf6709b9)

But,
When creating a project from Project Template, the project expected start and end dates don’t respect the Templates task dates. The newly created project has all tasks set to start and end today.

The following image show project scheduling of Template tasks:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ae63f37-29b7-4115-a9e5-e400a55c283b)

But when I created a New Project the tasks copied from Project template do not take over the start/end dates.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcc3672d-9ed5-4e8f-8ee9-01c684bae20b)

The code states otherwise, the dates must have been copied.

When we will create an actual project, the project will have an expected start date and based on that we can calculate the start and end dates of tasks. But to calculate that as well, you need to define ""Expected Hours"" in the template tasks.

anup-dh (Issue Creator) on (2025-01-15 06:50:36 UTC): Hello, Nice question.


Just like the Payment schedule table/payment terms template. *I know this uses credit days to add to the current date and calculate payment schedule for each invoice.* 
The same concept can be used to make the project module a little more robust. Please allow me to explain.

In Project template, we list out the tasks like this:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dac07cf-cb2c-4a6a-99cb-afa706692cb5)

For each of these tasks, we set start and end dates. While setting dates, the first task will be set to today's date and subsequent tasks will be post dated based on expected work hours needed (for that ""type"" of project: we will can have different project templates for different types of projects). So, if I made a project template today, and checked the expected start dates 5 years later, it will still have today's date as expected start date. However, magic happens when creating a project.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dabe27e-95e2-400c-86b1-6d8a8b2655cf)


While creating a project, we have this field: Expected Start Date.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bbaa8b8-2cef-4430-a5bc-01121a957eb0)

Lets assume a user creates a project today (Jan 15, 2025) and sets the Expected Start Date to 1.5 months later (assume March 1, 2025), and then selects a project template, the first task of that template (sorted by Expected start date) should be set to start at March 1 2025 and accordingly to other tasks. This way all new tasks created will maintain project timeline hierarchy. Else, all new tasks created will have this weird Gantt view which will provide no sense to project planning unless we intervene each tasks. Imagine doing this to all 20 new projects starting every month, each having more than 500 tasks. 🗡 🗡 🗡 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e17a8bbb-82bd-4e3b-b213-a3a1a283de8a)

If a project template looks this good, why not just copy this to each project starting with the template ?

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5f13710-666a-486d-9227-683f171751af)


Also what I am not able to understand is this line of code:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/334fc57e-345a-47b3-b26c-031f0951e0d4)

Why put it there if it is doing nothing ?  If this one works:

I've seen some organically grown discrepancies between some of the client side and server side calculations that already seemed accidental in nature while doing the refactor.

This is definitely a regression / oversight though.

2684718179,issue,open,,BOM Item Rate not fetched under certain conditions of UOM,"### Information about bug

Let's say you have two Units Of Measure defined (A and B), and a UOM Conversion Factor between them.
You've got an Item whose Default UOM is A.
You've saved an Item Price whose UOM is B.
Now you go to add the Item to a BOM raw materials table. Set Rate of Materials Based on = Price List
- **If you use UOM A in the BOM table, ERPNext fails to fetch a Rate for the Item.**
- If you use UOM B in the BOM table, the rate is fetched correctly and UOM Conversion Factor correctly applied.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3bb87a7-99c1-42b9-89c0-37d079537d54)

This behavior is the same regardless of these settings:
- ""Must be whole number"" field for UOMs involved
- ""Price Not UOM Dependent"" field for Price List

This contradicts the expected behavior based on the [documentation for Price List settings](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/price-lists):

> Price Not UOM Dependent: Consider an item, Tomatoes which you buy in Boxes and sell in Kilos. 1 Box = 10 Kilos and 1 Kilo buying price is 10rs. If this Box is unchecked and you select 1 Box in your transaction, the price will show up only for a Kilo since that's the only Item Price saved.
Now, if you tick this checkbox and make a transaction with a Box of Tomatoes, then the price will be automatically set as 100 since the price of 1 Box (10 Kilos) is 100. * Standard Buying and Selling Price Lists are created by default.

Also see https://discuss.frappe.io/t/bom-price-calculation-per-used-uom-conversion-not-working/66183

Why is this annoying
- It's common to buy in one UOM and consume in a different UOM. So you should be able to enter an Item Price in the UOM you buy in, and enter a BOM Item in the UOM you consume in.
- Sometimes there's an order of magnitude difference between units; like you buy something by the kilo and use it by the gram. This can force you to use very high precision / decimal places in your prices; it is better if you can rely on the nice existing UOM conversion feature to avoid rounding errors.
- The same-UOM requirement is counter intuitive and frustrating.

### Steps to Replicate
- Create ERPNext demo site with demo data (I did this with ERPNext: v15.48.3, Frappe Framework: v15.52.0)
- Create new UOM Conversion Factor: **1 Box = 10 Nos**
- Create a new BOM
  - Produced Item = any existing Item, doesn't matter
  - Cost Configuration >> Rate of Materials Based on = **Price List**
  - Cost Configuration >> Price List = **Standard Buying**
  - To the Raw Materials/Items table, add **SKU001** (a T-shirt).
    - UOM defaults to **Nos**
    - **Result: Rate of 400 fetched as expected.**
  - Change the T-shirt UOM to **Box**
    - **Result: Rate of 4,000 fetched as expected.**
So everything seems to work when the Item Price UOM = the Item's Default UOM (which is Nos in this case).
- Now open the Item Price for the T-shirt:
  - Change UOM from Nos to **Box**
  - Change Rate from 400 to **4,000**
  - I.e. the per-unit price is staying the same
- Go back to your BOM:
  - Change the T-shirt UOM to **Nos**
    - **Result: No rate fetched. Error: ""Price not found for item SKU001 in price list Standard Buying""**
  - Change the T-shirt UOM to **Box**
    - **Result: Rate of 4,000 fetched as expected.**

2682950496,issue,open,,Deadlock Issue in Custom Payment Reconciliation RQ Job for Bulk Transactions,"### Information about bug

**Description:**
We have implemented a custom RQ job function for payment reconciliation in ERPNext. The job is derived from the trigger_reconciliation_for_queued_docs function in erpnext/accounts/doctype/process_payment_reconciliation/process_payment_reconciliation.py. In our customization, we made minor modifications by commenting out the queue_size code to process all entries at once.
Our goal is to reconcile all customer and supplier payments and invoices in a single run at 2:30 AM daily. While the process handles most of the workload efficiently, we encounter deadlock errors when reconciling high volumes of transactions. This typically occurs for 60–70 transactions, with 4–5 transactions encountering deadlock errors.


**Error Details:**
**Error Title:** erpnext.accounts.doctype.process_payment_reconciliation.process_payment_reconciliation.fetch_and_allocate
Traceback:
sql
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""apps/frappe/frappe/utils/background_jobs.py"", line 220, in execute_job
    retval = method(**kwargs)
  ...
  File ""apps/frappe/frappe/database/database.py"", line 240, in sql
    raise frappe.QueryDeadlockError(e) from e
frappe.exceptions.QueryDeadlockError: (1213, 'Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction')

**Relevant Context:**
We are using 2 workers in a single bench.
The issue arises when the job processes entries in bulk, causing some transactions to fail due to deadlocks.
The affected function is fetch_and_allocate, which leads to deadlocks while performing database operations (INSERT INTO or UPDATE queries) on tabProcess Payment Reconciliation Log Allocations.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
Implement a custom RQ job similar to trigger_reconciliation_for_queued_docs.
Process all Process Payment Reconciliation Doctype entries in a single run.
Execute the job during high transaction loads.
Observe the deadlock errors in the logs for a subset of transactions.

2679246461,issue,open,,Currency Precision Issue in Journal Entry giving: Total Debit must be equal to Total Credit. The difference is -0.0000001,"### Information about bug

**This issue has been tracked for 3 years now**
- On the forum [here](https://discuss.frappe.io/t/total-debit-must-be-equal-to-total-credit-the-difference-is-0-009999999999990905/95779) and [here](https://discuss.frappe.io/t/multicurrency-journal-entry-debit-must-equal-credit/49301) in Version-15 AFAIK
- There's also this [related github issue which was closed without resolution](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/issues/36698) in Version-14

### **Expected behaviour:**
Journal Entry should be able to ignore the debit credit difference if its under the standard or set currency precision.

### **Actual Behaviour**
Getting Exception Message: Total Debit must be equal to Total Credit. The difference is -0.000000XXXX

### **Workaround**
The only workaround is reducing **Currency Precision** to 1 decimal place in **System Settings**

### **Suggested Solution**
I believe we can resolve the issue by ignoring small discrepancies less than 0.01 by rounding-up one of the amounts so that there's no difference

We can change 

```
	def set_total_debit_credit(self):
		self.total_debit, self.total_credit, self.difference = 0, 0, 0
		for d in self.get(""accounts""):
			if d.debit and d.credit:
				frappe.throw(_(""You cannot credit and debit same account at the same time""))

			self.total_debit = flt(self.total_debit) + flt(d.debit, d.precision(""debit""))
			self.total_credit = flt(self.total_credit) + flt(d.credit, d.precision(""credit""))

		self.difference = flt(self.total_debit, self.precision(""total_debit"")) - flt(
			self.total_credit, self.precision(""total_credit"")
		)
```

To 

```
	def set_total_debit_credit(self):
		self.total_debit, self.total_credit, self.difference = 0, 0, 0

		# Calculate total debit and credit
		for d in self.get(""accounts""):
			if d.debit and d.credit:
				frappe.throw(_(""You cannot credit and debit the same account at the same time""))

			self.total_debit += flt(d.debit, d.precision(""debit""))
			self.total_credit += flt(d.credit, d.precision(""credit""))

		# Compute the difference with rounding
		self.difference = flt(
			flt(self.total_debit, self.precision(""total_debit"")) - 
			flt(self.total_credit, self.precision(""total_credit"")),
			self.precision(""difference"")
		)

		# Adjust for small discrepancies
		if abs(self.difference) <= 0.01:
			if self.total_debit > self.total_credit:

I am unable to use the default reports such as sales analytics to generate reports filtered by time. As at now, the sales analytics report can be filtered by date but not by time. As such, we are unable to analyze the transactions within the day.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Can the team change the date filters in the default reports to include time? This would solve the problem and make it possible to analyze transactions within a day and segregate by hours or minutes or seconds.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
We have considered using the report builder to generate what we need but it is not as efficient as just having the core reports such as sales analytics report have the date filters, hence, the reason for this request.

It would be great to have this request implemented for all the other core reports

2675813926,issue,open,,A better Pricing Features with Tiered Pricing and Cumulative Tiered Pricing,"ERPNext’s basic pricing model doesn’t meet the needs of businesses that demand flexible, competitive, and dynamic pricing strategies. If the pricing module requires scripting to achieve even moderately complex configurations, it defeats the purpose of a user-friendly ERP.

Specifically, it lacks features for cumulative tiered pricing and tier-based flat rate pricing, which are essential for industries requiring flexible and detailed pricing models. Adding these features will significantly enhance ERPNext’s utility and competitiveness.

**Proposed Features:**

### 1. Cumulative Tiered Pricing
Definition:

Allow pricing to calculate the total cost by applying the price of each tier proportionally to the quantity within that tier.
For example:
Tier 1 (1–10 units): $10/unit
Tier 2 (11–20 units): $8/unit
Tier 3 (21+ units): $6/unit
If a customer purchases 25 units:
10 units at $10/unit = $100
10 units at $8/unit = $80
5 units at $6/unit = $30
Total = $210

Use Case:

Commonly used in wholesale, where pricing per unit decreases progressively as quantities increase.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2. Tier-Based Flat Rate Pricing
Definition:

Allow flat rates to be applied for specific tiers instead of per-unit pricing, while maintaining tier-based pricing for other ranges.
For example:
From 1–10 units: $50 flat (regardless of quantity within this range).
From 11–20 units: $8/unit.
21+ units: $6/unit.
If a customer purchases 15 units:
Flat rate for the first 10 units = $50
5 units at $8/unit = $40
Total = $90
Use Case:

Ideal for scenarios where small quantities need a fixed cost (e.g., packaging fees, setup costs) but larger orders follow tiered pricing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Case Example:

Imagine having a service that is charged depending on the number of page worked on. For 1 to 10 pages, we want to charge a flat rate of $650. For 11 to 30 pages we charge $650+ $100/pages. For 31 to 100 pages we charge $650 + $100x20pages + $90/pages.

This is a very common pricing model used for wholesales companies and services based companies. It's impossible to do it with ERPnext Pricing Rules.

### Suggested implementation
Adding the Tiers directly to the Item when creating them and applying the rules using the pricing rules feature. For each tier we should be able to decide between a flat rate or an UOM based rate.

barredterra (Issue Creator) on (2024-12-04 13:17:10 UTC): There is no way to set a tax as not applicable, apart from setting it to zero. So the dict should likely only contain accounts where the applicable rate is not 0 for the respective item.

blaggacao (Assginee) on (2024-12-04 13:39:58 UTC): That in turn is unfortunately not possible, because `0` is a legitimate and meaningful tax rate distinct from ""no tax at all"".


I looked into the DE setup and it was genuinely news to me that the system could be used in such a way, but I can see how this is a useful feature to filter taxes based on the document's general tax template.

This feature also seems to be the true semantic meaning behind disabling the Account setting ""append item taxes to tax table"".

Since it is, in essence an overlay data structure that was chosen to implement the feature, `nil` values become inherently significant. Their absence is a design flaw and shortcoming in the original implementation of that feature.

I'd suggest to modify the tax templates tables to add a check which signifies a nil value &mdash; potentially visible only if the respective accounting setting is disabled. When taxes from such templates are then assembled, this checkmark could cause them to be represented properly as `nil` values. Alternatively, a special sentinel value can be used (e.g. `-1`), but I could not think of one that is not also a legitimate rate.

2671332005,issue,open,,Float or Dynamic Account Type in ERPNext,"**The importance of Float or Dynamic Account Type**
1- Accounting Standards and Industry Practices
While traditional accounting standards might not explicitly define a “float account,” the concept is common in certain financial systems, particularly in sectors where accounts need to be reclassified based on their balance nature (e.g., banking, treasury management, or project-based accounting).

Many accounting software systems offer similar functionality, often under different names, to provide flexibility for businesses with unique financial reporting needs. ERPNext’s adaptability could be a competitive advantage by including this feature.

2- Automating Period-End Adjustments
Manually changing the account type before issuing a period closing voucher might work for smaller setups but becomes cumbersome for larger organizations or those with multiple accounts requiring reclassification.

3- Automating the process, as suggested, still requires initial customization, testing, and maintenance. Incorporating this feature into ERPNext natively would save effort and reduce the potential for errors.

4- Flexibility and Scalability
A float account type would empower ERPNext users to handle more dynamic business scenarios without frequent manual intervention or workarounds.

5- This feature would particularly benefit multinational or multi-industry organizations that have to comply with varied reporting requirements, where account nature changes based on regulatory or operational needs.

6- Practical Use Case
For instance, an “advances from customers” account might have a credit balance (liability) when customers prepay but could shift to a debit balance (asset) if overpayments occur or adjustments are made. A float account type would simplify handling such scenarios.

7- User-Centric Enhancement
ERPNext is known for its user-focused design. Adding this feature would align with that philosophy by addressing diverse accounting needs, potentially increasing adoption in industries that demand such functionality.

8- Precedents in ERP Systems
Other ERP systems like SAP, Oracle, or Sage often support dynamic reclassification of accounts, demonstrating the practicality and demand for this feature.",hameedacpa,2024-11-19 08:48:47+00:00,[],2024-11-19 08:56:58+00:00,,https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/issues/44205,"[('feature-request', None)]","[{'comment_id': 2485079804, 'issue_id': 2671332005, 'author': 'hameedacpa', 'body': '![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe3bc741-dc71-4d61-8f0e-93add69d78c2)\r\nThe fields should be redesigned and add check box to select if it is ""Fload Account""\r\nIn case it is float/dynamic account then the classifications and types should be based on Credit and Debit, I mean here if it is Debit balance where it should show in the chart of accounts and if it is Credit where is should show in chart of accounts', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 11, 19, 8, 56, 57, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)}]","hameedacpa (Issue Creator) on (2024-11-19 08:56:57 UTC): ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe3bc741-dc71-4d61-8f0e-93add69d78c2)

2668247252,issue,open,,Quantity error in Purchase Return / Invoice,"### Information about bug

Purchase return quantity is added in Total quantity purchased during creation of PI.
Creating a video to show error would be great but it crossed the file size limit so, I am illustrating with images.

This is the original Purchase Order (PO): [ Including 13% VAT, amount = 122613 ]
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32e9200b-6529-4ffd-b387-25891f29c39f)

These items were received at two different times partially.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f22168bb-20b6-4167-a80e-d1f7daf26bd4)
55854.70+66758.37 =~ 122613

The PRE-24-000326 has returns filed.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6de71572-98db-4f5a-bbca-d89c8abc1563)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0516fdb8-c8c5-4af5-9fa4-5b0f55a10774)

Our workflow was: 
PO created  on 2024.07.05 -> Purchase received on 2024.07.08 and 07.12 -> Purchase return on 2024.07.22

Now we are trying to create Purchase Invoices. 

A. From PO: because we thought it would be easier.

Issue 1:  We are seeing the returned item in orange color, meaning : to be received. If we create Purchase receipt again, the exact returned quantity shows up. ERPNext thinks this quantity is returned (may be faulty item received) and will be delivered again. But this quantity was **NOT rejected** during receipt but excess (not required because initial order was over estimated) quantity was returned. I think this should be handled differently. Anyway its not a big deal. Lets move on.

When trying to create PI from that PO, this table is fetched.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6de3b180-9925-4a90-830d-67655b31f60d)

All quantities are okay except the first one.

In PO: 348.88 
In PI: 418.30
Difference: 69.42

This is the exact quantity that was returned. (check screen shot above).

Luckily, the PI does not get submitted. But this quantity pulled is WRONG.


B. Create PI from Purchase receipts.

Lets start with the PR which has returns filed against.: PRE-24-00326
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47b67401-1d40-492e-9ab4-2fa57d2b41df)

PI pulls right quantity (after return)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/240d7401-9de5-4537-bbe3-50c8c4a2b0f6)

This PI is saved and submitted.

I again go on to create PI for another PR, saved and submitted.

Then I create Debit Note (PI from Purchase Return document)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7bd2edc-7b41-48eb-a2a9-4a8600f0ad7f)

This is also saved and submitted.

Now lets check the GL.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fd271ea-3737-48ae-8e93-6c34548f6263)
It shows a net payable of 104563 while it should only be : 122613 - 9025 = 113588

The problem here is: PI created from Purchase receipt (that has returns) deducted the amount and quantity worth the return and if our staff would create Debit note from Purchase return, the same transaction will now be double booked.

This problem would not have occured if PI were created first from PR and then Debit note/Purchase return was filed. 

May be ERPNext must restrict such transactions entry.

2662496142,issue,open,,Issue with Invoicing Partial Timesheet Details,"### Information about bug

When I create a new Sales Invoice via the Sales Workspace and load the timesheets of a project via the Fetch Timesheet, all timesheets are marked as billed, even if there are still time bookings from other projects in the same timesheets. If I create a sales invoice directly via a project, I do not have this problem.

**Steps to reproduce the bug:**
1. Create a timesheet with multiple timesheet details for different projects.
   For example:
    - Timesheet Detail 1: 10 hours for Project 1, marked as billable.
    - Timesheet Detail 2: Hours for Project 2, also marked as billable.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebcf5e55-0e36-406c-88a0-ed65b38fc1af)
2. Submit the timesheet.
3. Create a sales invoice via the sales workspace and use ""Fetch Timesheets"" to get billable hours for one of the projects (e.g., Project 1) from timesheets. You get 10 hours.
![Screenshot 2024-11-15 at 5 42 02 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8aa2740-3b48-4a95-9966-371e586d3246)

4. After submitting the sales invoice, observe that all the hours in the timesheet are marked as billed, rather than just the hours for the invoiced project.
5. Attempt to create a sales invoice for the second project (e.g., Project 2). Notice that the remaining 10 hours no longer appear as available to invoice, even though they haven’t been invoiced yet.

**Expected Behavior:**
Only the hours associated with the invoiced project (e.g., Project 1) should be marked as billed, leaving the hours for other projects available for invoicing.

**Actual Behavior:**
The entire timesheet is marked as billed after invoicing one project, preventing further invoicing of other projects' hours.

2657960582,issue,closed,completed,Payment Entry In Words is wrong if not company currency,"### Information about bug

When the payment made is not in company currency, the base_in_words and the in_words field have the same value. When I checked the code, it seems to be incorrect.

If you look at the code below, you can see that if the payment type is Receive, then the amount used to print is received_amount and vice versa for paid. Please check the below screenshots

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8fb7370-b291-46ab-8b5d-bfbe71c2d4f1)

As you can see if it is Receive, then the amount actually comes in paid_amount and base_paid_amount but the function takes received_amount and base_received_amount and vice versa for Pay.
Hence the In words comes like this

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/032b1a58-9c57-4fb5-9ba1-e4b8f762fea0)

Both company currency and the other in words are the same data.

2657814863,issue,open,,"Unreconciling a Payment Entry Removes the Reconciliation Entry, Affecting Trial Balance","### Information about bug

When a payment entry is unreconciled, the original entry which is created after reconciliation is removed from the system, which causes an issue in the trial balance. This behavior is incorrect as it impacts the accuracy of financial reports. The system should create a separate cancellation entry on the same date to ensure that the trial balance remains accurate.

Below example shows the issue, We have posted the payment entry on 13/09/24 and reconciled it on 09/11/24. When we unreconciled it the entry posted on 09/11/24 is got removed and Trial balance get changed.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1.	Create a payment entry and reconcile it with an invoice.
2.	Unreconcile the payment entry.
3.	Check the trial balance or the related financial reports.
4.	Notice that the original payment entry is removed, affecting the trial balance.

**Expected Behavior:** When a payment entry is unreconciled, the system should not remove the entry. Instead, it should create a separate cancellation entry on the same date to keep the trial balance accurate.

**Actual Behavior:** The payment entry is removed when unreconciled, which leads to discrepancies in the trial balance.

2654955779,issue,open,,Payment Reconciliation Program Does Not Consider Journal Voucher Entries for Reconciliation,"### Information about bug

**Description:**
In our business scenario, we are using Journal Vouchers (JVs) for recording bank charges and advance received from Customer. However, the standard Payment Reconciliation program in ERPNext does not consider Journal Voucher (JV) type documents during reconciliation.
This is causing discrepancies in the reconciliation process as the JV entries are not being included, resulting in incomplete or incorrect reconciliation.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1.	Create a Journal Voucher (JV) for bank charges.
2.	Attempt to run the Payment Reconciliation program.
3.	Observe that the JV entry is not considered in the reconciliation process.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad05b007-ee3b-43b8-8f42-9e5216d09aa4)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/972d030e-32f2-4d50-9d87-5b40570dd1c4)

**Expected Behaviour:**
The Payment Reconciliation program should consider Journal Voucher entries (such as bank charges) during reconciliation so that the process completes correctly and accurately.
**Actual Behaviour:**
Journal Voucher entries are not considered in the Payment Reconciliation program, causing incomplete or incorrect reconciliation.
**Suggested Solution:**
Include Journal Voucher (JV) type documents in the Payment Reconciliation program logic so that all related transactions, including bank charges recorded via JVs, are included in the reconciliation 

**Additional Information:**
•	We are using Journal Vouchers specifically for recording bank charges, but the system currently ignores them during the reconciliation process.
•	Including the JV entries in the reconciliation would resolve this issue and ensure accurate accounting for bank charges.

2654911651,issue,open,,Payment Entry Cleared with Incorrect Date (Sales Invoice Date Instead of Current Date),"### Information about bug

We have posted a payment entry on 20-09-2024 and a sales invoice on 05-10-24, the system is incorrectly using the sales invoice date for the clearing process, rather than the current date or the user-defined date.
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1.	Create a Payment Entry on 20-09-24.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62baa418-e37d-4cfb-b485-e92743041edb)
2.	Create a Sales Invoice on 05-10-24
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e525d5b-ac35-4e69-a2e6-02ec41d63dbd)
3.	Attempt to clear the payment entry by linking it to the sales invoice.
5.	The system picks the sales invoice date (05-10-24) for the clearing entry, instead of using the current date(13-11-24) or the date specified by the user.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff1e94eb-55cf-49e1-bfaa-2b3f331ee23d)

**Expected Result:** The clearing process should use the current date or a date that is manually selected by the user for the clearing, not the sales invoice date.

**Actual Result:** The system automatically uses the sales invoice date for the clearing process. This is resulting in incorrect accounting process.

**Suggested Fix:** Modify the logic to ensure that the date used for the clearing process is either the current date or a user-defined date, rather than defaulting to the sales invoice date.

2652585870,issue,closed,completed,Submitting Work Order with connected Serial Number generates a second Serial Number.,"### Information about bug

1. Create Work Order for quantity (1) for an Item that Has Serial No and Save.
2. On Connections sheet, select Serial No and Add Serial No.
3. Enter information for new Serial No and Save.
4. Return to previous Work Order and inspect Connection sheet to see new Serial Number is connected to Work Order.
5. Submit Work Order.
6. Another Serial Number is created and connected to the Work Order.

This bug affects importing Work Orders and Serial Numbers from another ERP system.  After Work Orders are imported without being submitted, Serial Numbers are imported with the connected Work Order mentioned in the work_order field.  However, when the Work Orders are then submitted, a second Serial Number is created and connected to the Work Order.

System should check for existing number of connected Serial Numbers and only generate Serial Numbers if needed.

2650972488,issue,open,,[feature request] [feat] : Repack and Transfer for Manufacture,"### Use Case : 
In Manufacturing there are several cases when one item (RM) is **_cut_** (operation)  to generate multiple pieces (FG) which are used for the manufacturing.

As we know when the FG are multiple the only option is to use **Repack**.

e.g. it is defined in the BOM 
Sheet A - 5kg  ( Raw Material- One Input ) as  Batch item with Batch =  General 
but in the item description  specification is defined as below ( multiple Semi Finished Good - Multiple Output)
| Item    | Batch-Specification | Qty  
| -------- | ------- |------- |
| Sheet A  | B1 - 600mm X1200 mm |  2Kg 
| Sheet A  |  B2- 400mm x 1000mm  |3Kg

Option should be given in the Job Card for Stock Entry ( Material Transfer for Manufacture with Repack )

which will help to supply Sheet A - 5kg by converting 5Kg in  two batches as below

| -------- | ------- |------- |
| Sheet A  | B1- 600mm X1200 mm |  2Kg 
| Sheet A  |  B2 -400mm x 1000mm  |3Kg

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A request to develop a Consolidated Sales Analytics report, reporting across all child companies under a parent company. This report shall allow users to quickly compare sales and identify which child companies are performing well or need attention.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Consolidated Sales Analytics in which if a parent company is chosen, the analytics data would also include all the child company transactions or refactor the existing Sales Analytics report while solving its permission issues (43935) and also include this feature.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

**Requested Enhancement:**
Please add the ability in the **BOM Creator Tool** to include operations specifically for subassemblies in multi-level BOMs. This would make the tool more flexible and efficient for users with complex assembly needs.
