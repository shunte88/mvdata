blaggacao (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-02 13:54:59 UTC): @ruthra-kumar @s-aga-r Since I'm sprinting on https://github.com/frappe/payments/pull/53 to make payments more reliable in ERPNext (the current situation in production is brittle), this PR came up among the following more:

- https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/40774
- https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/40643
- and crucially: https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/40424

It would help me a lot if you can afford in some form or shape to ""mirror"" this sprint in the sense to review / merge acceptable increments somewhat swiftly.

My end goal remains to robustly implement PayZen atop https://github.com/frappe/payments/pull/53 and face-lift the payment infrastructure so that implementing new payment gateways becomes more reliable and (hopefully also: easier) for the greater community.

The current situation is not really tenable and source of a major maintenance headache in our production deployment. We're iterating on this for the 3rd time, now, and the legacy spaghetti (I hope this is an undisputed claim :smile:) really didn't help me nor the business bottom line. :cry:

2215855566,pull_request,closed,,feat: significant enhancements to sales analytics report to support charts,"The Sales Analytics report currently only shows charts if the data rows are selected in the datatable in the browser. This means it is incompatible with dashboard charts which expect the data to be delivered server-side.

The data is also arranged in the wrong orientation for dashboard charts which expect the X axis labels to be in the data vertically, but are horizontal in this report, which means you cannot use the report data output either.

All added features:

- An extra 'Curves' filter which defaults to 'Select' to support old behaviour, but has the following additional modes to support dashboard charts (generated server-side):

    - All - shows all data rows on the chart
    - Non-Zeros - shows only non-zero data rows
    - Total Only - shows a single curve which is the total of the data rows

- A special 'All' document mode (shown below) which shows all Sales cycle documents in Customer, Value and Total Only mode, over the time period
- Quotations supported
- Sales Invoice (by due date) supported
- Payment Entry supported
- The Fiscal Year dynamic from/to filter can be overridden by setting two user defaults in JS:

```javascript
// used by sales_analytics report to give a custom time period in charts
const wk = frappe.datetime.week_start();
frappe.defaults.set_user_default_local('sales_start_date', frappe.datetime.add_months(wk,-2));
frappe.defaults.set_user_default_local('sales_end_date',   frappe.datetime.add_months(wk,1));
```

One known issue: Payment entries do not 'know about' the taxes (the other reports show net amounts), so will always be more than the other document values.

2215224696,pull_request,closed,,fix: budget validation for purchase orders,"### Bug

Validation for budget fails even though the actual expense in Purchase Orders is less than the budget amount.

When the `get_amount` function is called for getting the expenses that will occur through Purchase Orders, the actual expense for purchase invoices is added once.

https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/8e522183bc417b52253315cd3784a125eea671d8/erpnext/accounts/doctype/budget/budget.py#L302-L311

However, when validation runs, the actual expense is added again to the total amount to compare against the budget amount.

https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/8e522183bc417b52253315cd3784a125eea671d8/erpnext/accounts/doctype/budget/budget.py#L252-L256

<hr>

### Fix 

- Add expense amount only once to the total expense before validating against the budget amount.
- Show breakup of expenses booked through Actual Expenses, Material Requests, Unbilled Orders with links to relevant reports.

### Expense Breakup
