2491582620,pull_request,closed,,fix: A project without tasks should be able to complete,"This fix solves a bug where, when completing a project without tasks, it will fail to close.

- If a project without tasks is set to ""Completed"", either through setting the project status directly or with the ""set_project_status"" function, the status is not changed but reverted back to ""Open"".

- The reason for this behaviour is, that since there are no tasks to provide a completion percentage erpnext will not accept the ""Completed"" status.

- While failing the bug does not throw an error or warning message to the user, hence I am assuming the behaviour is unintentional and needs to be fixed.

- This fix solves the bug by changing the completion type to manual on completing the project if there are no tasks within the project

- The lack of proper linkage between the purchase receipt and the purchase invoice leads to duplicate debits in the GL.

Plaid doesn't always return a bank account from `Plaid.create`--sometimes there's an error. The existing code has no error handling for this scenario. What's broken in that case is the user experience.

I suggest you post a bug with an error log that your PR fixes.

2489045057,pull_request,closed,,refactor: item-wise purchase history (query to script report) (backport #41949),"**Before:**

- item-wise sales history is a server script report, and item-wise purchase history is a query report. It is difficult to view in the query report because it lacks filters.

![image](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/assets/141945075/fd9b55b9-fa4e-4a8e-8ed4-55e2cac51d3a)

**After:**

- We've developed a server script report from the query report. The ""item-wise purchase history"" report now resembles the ""item-wise sales history"" report, making it easier to view.

2487860161,pull_request,closed,,fix: getting scrap items from sub assemblies by fetching scrap items for parent BOM,"Closes #40658 
### Problem:
- when creating a **Stock Entry** from a **Work Order**  (click on **finish** button on **Work Order** and enter **Qty for Manufacture** and click **Create**). Specifically, when the ""**Set Operating Cost / Scrap Items From Sub-assemblies**"" option is enabled in **Manufacturing Settings**, the **Stock Entry fails** to correctly **fetch the scrap items** for BOM Item that on Work Order.

- The problem occurs because the scrap items from sub-assemblies do not consider the BOM Scrap Item of the Parent BOM (fieldlabel : _BOM No_ ) in the Work Order. This leads to incorrect stock entries.

#### How to reproduce the bug :bug: :

### Proposed Solution
This update will ensure that the **Stock Entry** accurately considers the Parent BOM's scrap items when generating stock entries from Work Orders.

When creating assets from purchase invoices or receipts with items that have the same item_code but different values, it was difficult to determine the correct item value due to the lack of clear linkage.

The current asset capitalization process is incorrectly booking amounts directly into the Asset Account instead of the Capital Work in Progress (CWIP) account when a WIP composite asset is selected. Despite enable_cwip_accounting=1 being set and the CWIP account configured for the asset category, the system bypasses the CWIP account.

- When an asset is created and capitalized, the expected behavior is that the amount should first be booked into the CWIP account if the asset is designated as a WIP composite asset.

2477046538,pull_request,closed,,feat: account heads changed along with journal entry type and descrip…,"## Background/Context

- On the submission of asset value adjustment, automatically journal entry is passed in which depreciation and accumulated depreciation accounts are used to adjust the value

- Also, the negative amount is passed in the journal entry in case of increase in asset value.
- Journal entry type is of depreciation instead of journal entry.
- Remark of journal entry is of depreciation entry instead of revaluaton entry.
- Accounting Dimension values not getting updated

## Solution Summary
- Provide a field named “Difference account” and one can choose the revaluation or impairment account as may be the case differ
- No negative entry is allowed in the journal entry passed.
- Journal entry type is to be set to journal entry.
- Remark of journal entry is to be set as revaluation entry.
- Accounting Dimension values getting fetched from asset and updated in Journal Entry

**1. In the Asset Value Adjustment Doctype, we have added a new ‘Difference Account’ box.**
![image (12) (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b971ce94-abb2-4867-bc13-7596f02fa926)

**2. When the value of asset is increasing, the fixed asset account from the asset category is debited and the difference account mentioned at the asset value adjustment doctype is credited. The opposite will happen when  the asset value is decreasing. Also, the entry type is changed from Depriciation Entry to Journal Entry**

2477039170,pull_request,closed,,fix: prevent TypeError when updating PO items without linked SO item,"### Bug:
When updating an item in a Purchase Order with button: **Update Items**, an error occurs if there is no Sales Order Item associated with the Purchase Order Item.   TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'float'

### Summary
This update fixes an issue where a NoneType error or TypeError occurred during the deletion of an item or adjustment of ordered quantities in non-linked or linked Sales Orders.

### Key Fixes:
1. **Handling NoneType Values:** Prevents errors when ordered_qty or qty are None.
2. **Ensuring Type Consistency:** Converts values to floats to avoid TypeError when performing calculations.
3. **Preventing Negative Quantities:** Ensures that calculated quantities do not go below 0.",mahowell,2024-08-21 04:40:43+00:00,[],2024-11-30 00:11:52+00:00,2024-11-14 06:11:21+00:00,https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/42844,"[('needs-tests', 'This PR needs automated unit-tests.'), ('inactive', '')]","[{'comment_id': 2343603297, 'issue_id': 2477039170, 'author': 'stale[bot]', 'body': ""This pull request has been automatically marked as inactive because it has not had recent activity.

2476278905,pull_request,closed,,refactor: use common functionality to validate account number,"> Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request:

In France we have chart of account where the same Account number can be use as Liability or as Asset ( the root_type do not exists like that but in France, it imply other definition and meaning but we try to find a way to allow proper French accountancy in ERPNext)

We can understand that add root_type to the check the uniqueness of a Account number may not please all country accountancy rules.
So we can also change the PR to always send root_type as parameters and not use it for standard/core test of uniqueness but add @erpnext.allow_regional on the validate_account_number() function.
Like that we can override it in [ERPNext France](https://github.com/scopen-coop/erpnext_france) app

> Explain the **details** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?

This PR make two changes :

    Use the same method/function on Account creation as on Account update to check the validity of the account number
    Send root_type as parameters to validate_account_number() to check account number uniqueness by company and root_type

Although function names are same, there is only marginal overlap. But if you look closely, they do things differently based on context of use.

eg:
Stock Entry only needs valuation rate for items where stock is maintained. This needs to be precise with batch or serial number information which may not be available at the time of creation of Sales Order (as this is finalized at the time of Delivery Note).

Where as the one used here for Sales Order, tries to set valuation rate even for Non-Stock Item (Say Service Item) based on purchases made (not sure why though??). Probably to give a rough idea of estimated Gross Profit.

casesolved-co-uk on (2024-08-27 13:45:48 UTC): Then why don't you have a single function that determines the valuation rate in all conditions?

There's no reason an item should have a value ONLY if it is stocked. Everything you buy and sell will have a value.
