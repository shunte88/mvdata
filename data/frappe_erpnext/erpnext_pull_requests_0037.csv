2240239306,pull_request,closed,,fix: correct creation of opportunity with lead dashboard plus button,"Currently the logic used in the ""Create Opportunity"" does not use the same logic as the ""+"" button in the dashboard.
This creates a difference in behavior, especially the created opportunity is not linked by default.

It seems like the make_opportunity function was moved in this pr:
https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/31311

Which fixed the ""Create Opportunity"" button in the top bar but not the  ""+"" button in the dashboard.

2235939461,pull_request,closed,,fix: wrong value for total amount in payments (backport #40833),"A made a POS Invoice with total $518,17, with two payments mode:

1. Money: 13,00
2. Credit Card: 505,17

But when i try to create a RETURN POS Invoice against the origin invoice, with same payment methods but with (-) operator, i try submit i get the following message ""Total payments amount can't be greater than -518,17""

Debuging i saw a wrong value with decimal ""-518.1700000000001"" for variable total_amount_in_payments.

This normally happens when ""+="" is used, so before comparing I need to round to the number of decimal places in the total field that will be used in the comparison.
