Steps to Replicate:
- Create an Advance Receivable Account.
- Create a Sales Invoice
- Disable ""book_advance_payments_in_separate_party_account"" in company.
- Create a Payment Entry in the Advance Receivable Account. 
- Enable ""book_advance_payments_in_separate_party_account"".
- Reconciliation of the payment against the Invoice
- Reconciliation will be successful but outstanding will not be adjusted because the Party Account is different and payment entry is not advance payment entry.

2719563988,pull_request,closed,,Consider against_voucher_no when voucher_no is filtered,"**Issue:**
General Ledger does not consider the against voucher type and against voucher when there isn't any grouping
**ref:** [26554](https://support.frappe.io/helpdesk/tickets/26554)

**Solution:**
When there isn't any grouping and the voucher is filtered `Group by Voucher (Consolidated)` is set to `filters.group_by`, so the against_voucher_no is not taken into consideration.
I removed the `Group by Voucher (Consolidated)` assignment and ignored the opening and closing of the voucher
