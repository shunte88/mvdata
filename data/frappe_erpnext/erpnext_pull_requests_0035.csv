`copy_from_template_task` : for tasks call on validate and after_insert

The UOM conversion table was shown only for stock items.

### Problem

UOM conversion is needed for other items as well. It is quite common to trade goods and services in different UOMs while not tracking stock in ERPNext. I think this is common enough to be part of the standard, instead of customizing it on many sites.

### After

The UOM conversion table is always visible.

Quantity-based Calculation: Users can now specify shipping charges per item and apply discounts or limits based on the quantity ordered. This provides more flexibility in determining shipping costs, especially for scenarios where shipping charges vary based on order quantity.
Enhanced Flexibility: By introducing quantity-based calculation, this enhancement caters to a wider range of business requirements, allowing users to define shipping rules that better align with their shipping policies and pricing strategies.

Replication:

2. Make 50% advance with TDS deducted for PO. Note: this 50% should be above cumulative threshold.
3. Make an Invoice against PO with 25% value and allocate Advance. => No TDS applied

The combination of the 2 invoices should breach the cumulative threshold, and the total TDS for those invoices should be greater than the TDS deducted from the Advance Payment.

Refactor of margin and discount on all transactions so that either percentage or amount can be entered (the other is calculated), are never zeroed, and both are calculated from price list rate rather than discount being after margin is added.

## margin_type field in all transactions now deprecated. Remove in version 17
