2401440079,pull_request,closed,,feat: Allow unique Account number by root type (not unique for accros all Accounts),"
> Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request:

In France we have chart of account where the same Account number can be use as Liability or as Asset ( the root_type do not exists like that but in France, it imply other definition and meaning but we try to find a way to allow proper French accountancy in ERPNext)

We can understand that add root_type to the check the uniqueness of a Account number may not please all country accountancy rules.
So we can also change the PR to always send root_type as parameters and not use it for standard/core test of uniqueness but add @erpnext.allow_regional on the validate_account_number() function.
Like that we can override it in [ERPNext France](https://github.com/scopen-coop/erpnext_france) app

> Explain the **details** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?

This PR make two changes :

    Use the same method/function on Account creation as on Account update to check the validity of the account number
    Send root_type as parameters to validate_account_number() to check account number uniqueness by company and root_type

This is because this implementation may not be true for all.

Can this be configurable?

Only if it's true for many users. However in your case because you say this is specific to France, it's best to keep this as part of regional app.

Is Regional Override needed?

There are many ways to override functionalities in frappe. No in this case.
- A better PR would be where this method is part of the class Account.
- You could then override this method with class override hook of frappe.

FHenry (Issue Creator) on (2024-08-18 15:43:08 UTC): Hi @vorasmit,
Thank you to take time to answer.

Make an override class by hook is the last possible, and hard to maintain in long term, option for us.  I prefer to rely on standard core code.
If there is other app that override the same class, Frappe framework can't return a sure result (hook resolution sort order can be set, but it need human intervention).

I create another PR #42813 the try to make a allow_regional validate method. 
But as it is the only case I found in ERPNext base code on ""validate"" DocType Event, I'm not sure what is the best way to implement it. 
I choose to use return None if method is not hooked ""regionnal"",  then it will be the standard code, and if it's not the case it mean the regional method return something.
I have to change the method signature to add root_type as parameters.

Let us know what your thinking about it

vorasmit on (2024-08-20 13:40:58 UTC): I was suggesting changes as per the patch file attached. After this, you could override this with doctype class in a maintainable way.

[example.patch](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16676562/example.patch)

FHenry (Issue Creator) on (2024-08-20 18:28:13 UTC): @vorasmit 
Thank's for this patch. 

I've tested it by added an override_doctype_class in erpnext_france app for Account class and the new validate_account_number method of my override class is called instead of method validate_account_number of core class Account.

But, let's say there is another app in the bench, installed after erpnext_france, that override Account class with a override_doctype_class hook, the override_doctype_class for Account in erpnext_france is ignored.

So I can't be sure in whatever bench this patch will works.

But at least it's solution, for now, that give us hope.

I've close this PR and open a new one with your patch

2401411645,pull_request,closed,,feat: add allow_regional for make_gl_entries and make_reverse_gl_entries,"> Explain the **details** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?

For a common feature in France/Europe (but missing in ERPNext core), we've introduce in France Regional Localization app (https://github.com/scopen-coop/erpnext_france), the ""Deposit invoice"". That's a real Sales invoices / Purchase Invoice issuing (not Payment Request) based on % or fixed amount from a Sales Order / Purchase Order .
 
We need to adapt make_gl_entries and make_reverse_gl_entries method because the actual tax accounting is not correct according regional accountancy law.
Income amount from this type of invoice can have a different Account, and Tax amount could be accounted in split/spread Accounts if it talk about Goods or Service or also, but not only, depend Customer/Supplier country, and other case...

Actually, we almost manage to update GL entry after core ERPNext make_gl_entries/make_reverse_gl_entries but that not the good way of doing things.
This missing ""@erpnext.allow_regional"" on these methods force us to spend a lot's of time to ""hack"" ERPNext, and in some case do not allow to implement the legal requirement for France accounting law.

Let me know what do you think about this PR

The followings are fixs & feats for this issue.  
  1. [feat] Modify ""**Consolidate Sales Order Items**"" event by separate front-end & back-end  
     * Let ""**Get Finished Goods for Manufacture**"" event get items from server side without judging ""items need combined or not""   
     * Let ""**Consolidate Sales Order Items**"" event get data from server side to purely front-end combine same items.  
  2. [feat] Temporarily store data on global variables for combine items & release items.   


**Suggest**:  
    Sometimes, we need to check items from SO whether be manufactured or purchased.  
    Thus, if we using this patch, ""fix: do not fetch items with no active BOM in PP #41833"", we could not schedule/order work-order, purchase-order by PM.  

> **Screenshots/GIFs**

* **Consolidate status**

  2. Combine same items for each independent element.  
  4. Add item or no BOM item will not break consolidate.

* **Consolidate without using server side communication**

2399815180,pull_request,closed,,fix: updated logic for calculating tax_withholding_net_total in payment entry (backport #42060),"Issue:

Earlier TDS was deducted on base_tax_withholding_net_total even if the allocated amount is less than base_tax_withholding_net_total amount.

For eg:
PO = 100 + 18 = 118
Base Tax Withholding Net Total = 100 
o/s amount = 118
Paid amount = 50
Net Total Amount= 100

Fix:

Now TDS will be deducted on net_payable_amount_before tax or allocated amount whichever is less.
For eg:

PO = 100 + 18 = 118
Base Tax Withholding Net Total = 100 

1st Payment Entry
o/s amount = 118
Paid amount = 50
Net Base Tax Withholding Payable = 118-18 = 100

In the previous implementation, when an item-wise tax template was selected, the tax rate of that item was split proportionally among the valuation rates of all items in the list, leading to inaccurate item valuations.
This fix corrects the distribution of item-wise tax to the valuation rate of each item and ensures that only the item with a tax template selected reflects its own valuation rate.

_Also added validation to ensure that when a purchase tax template is selected, the item tax template is disregarded._

2394974923,pull_request,closed,,fix: Force Fetching updates on Subscriptions,"# Issue
Post [this](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/30963) refactor, `Fetch Subscription Updates` creates Invoices only if the Current Invoice Start / End date matches the current date. For old subscriptions, this also resets these values to the current periods' start and end dates without creating any pending invoices.

Consider the below subscription,

|||
|-|-|
|Subscription Start Date| 1st Jan|
|Subscription End Date|31 Dec|
|Plan Interval|1 Month|

and current date is 2nd March

When 'Fetch Subscription Updates' is triggered,
### Current behavior:
No Invoices are created for Jan and Feb and `current_invoice_start` and `current_invoice_end` date are updated to the latest month - March

### Expected behavior:
Invoice for January should be created and the `current_invoice_start` and `current_invoice_end` should be updated to February. Upon triggering 'Fetch Subscription Updated' again, the same should happen for February. Triggering it again, should not create any invoices as the current period - March, is not over.

# Fix
Adding a new Action button `Force-Fetch Subscription Updates`. This will have the expected behavior stated above, without allowing the scheduled job to create invoices for old subscriptions on its own.

 	ps = doc.flags.payment_session
 	if ps.changed:
 		payload = json.loads(doc.request_data)

Now making things doc methods just for this is probably not the best option, but I couldn't find another sane way to achieve this.

This is probably a design flaw in how whitelisting is implemented in combination with servers scripts.

Non-Solutions include: 
- Indiscriminate privilege escalation: `frappe.set_user(""Administrator"")`
- Use frappe client and hard-code (admin) passwords into server scripts
- ?

Maybe there's a more elegant way though, which wouldn't require ultimately an involved refactor to solve this problem at the root?
