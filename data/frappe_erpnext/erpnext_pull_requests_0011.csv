_**This pull-request is a continuation of the pull request [42416](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/42416).**_

The set_payment_schedule() function should not be used in Sales Invoices that are returns (see the reference below).

[Reference](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/483fd124fcf8ca4df34126e41f844820bc3e70f9/erpnext/controllers/accounts_controller.py#L470)

This commit adds a validation to prevent set_payment_schedule() from being called when creating a Sales Invoice from a Delivery Note, if the Sales Invoice is a return.

### How to simulate:

- Run in debug and add a breakpoint in the function ""set_payment_schedule"" (accounts_controller.py), for could assure that the function will be runned in the wrong moment
- Check ""automatically_fetch_payment_terms"" option in ""Accounts Settings"";
- Make a new Delivery Note;
- From the Delivery Note, create a Sales Return (Return Delivery Note);
- From the Return Delivery Note, create a Sales Invoice; The function ""set_payment_schedule"" is runned even being a return sales invoice.

Solution:
Remove the validation `validate_total_debit_and_credit` and let the user save Journal Entry. This will recalculate and correct the amounts shown.

The purpose of the stock closing entry is to generate the stock closing balance, which includes the consolidated stock quantity and consolidated stock value for the selected period. This will help to improve the performance of stock reports such as Stock Balance and Batch-Wise Balance History.

**How it works**

On submission of the stock closing entry, the system generates the stock closing balances based on the following combinations

- item, warehouse
- item, warehouse, batch no
- item, warehouse, dimension

If there are two inventory dimensions such as Rack and Bin then 
- item, warehouse, rack 1
- item, warehouse, bin 1
- item, warehouse, rack1, bin 1

While generating the stock balance report, system reads the opening stock from the Stock Closing Balance instead of stock ledger entries

2714383948,pull_request,closed,,fix: adjusted incoming rate for zero rated item in purchase receipt (backport #44415),"The incoming rate is not adjusted when the Item rate is 0 in the Purchase Receipt.

Steps To Replicate:
To replicate the issue:
- In Buying Settings, enable Set Landed Cost Based on Purchase Invoice Rate (you have to disable Maintain Same Rate Throughout the Purchase Cycle first)
- Create a Purchase Receipt with a 0 rate in Item.
-  Create a Purchase Invoice for the same receipt with some rate now
-  Check the value in Stock Balance and Trial Balance

2714368289,pull_request,closed,,fix: Always Calculate `sales_incoming_rate` for Internal Transfers (backport #44373),"### Fix (should have been done) in [this]( https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/42050):

- For internal transfer in Buying workflow, if `allow_internal_transfer_at_arms_length_price` is set, then rate will not update to the valuation rate but accounting will be done at valuation rate.

### Problem in above PR:

- The Valuation rate is calculated based on the `sales_incoming_rate`, but the `sales_incoming_rate` is only set if `allow_internal_transfer_at_arms_length_price` is unset, due to which for internal transfers at `arms length price`, the valuation is set again to `arms length price` as `sales_incoming_rate` is not set.

- Instead of using Product Bundle Details, Packed Item details are used for grouped invoices.
- This helps in consistency and performance

- Performance Fixes
  - Remove frappe.db.get_value for fetching base_net_amount instead of using item query.

2698726333,pull_request,closed,,fix: Initially Closing Amount Should be Equal to Expected Amount (backport #44316),"### Initial ERPNext Implementation:
- The `closing amount` is set to expected amount initially. But when user changes its value, then also in `before save` it is set again to `expected value`.

### After [this](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/43358) PR:
- The closing amount is only updated when closing amount is zero. So initially closing amount is set same as first invoice value.

### Current Fix:
- Initially the closing amount should be set same as expected amount , and should not be overridden when user changes the value.
