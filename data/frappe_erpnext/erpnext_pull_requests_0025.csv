2453642583,pull_request,closed,,fix: changes in opportunity.py to show contacts and addresses created from opportunity (backport #42596),"Hello everyone :),

we have created an issue with ERPNext, where we describe a problem with the creation of contacts and adresses from a opportunity.
https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/issues/42595

To see and understand the problem in its details, please look at the issue and take a look at the video i made for that. :)!

Therefore with this pull request we have already implemented a solution for that problem, which keeps the old functionality but also enables to show contacts and adresses created from a opportunity.

We have also made a video, where we show how our solution works. :) So please watch the video if you want to know more.

Thank you guys for considering this pull request and if you need anything, you can let me know.

Please backport to v15 and v14 if possible!

ruthra-kumar (Assginee) on (2024-08-29 09:39:28 UTC): This is exactly what I had suspected.

Process flow should not rely upon user setting the correct session defaults. Not every user will do that.
Ex:

Explicit is always better than Implicit.

Your changes do fix the problem, but I'm not sure there are no unintended side effects. Why do you add `source.payment_schedule = []` instead of removing the next 2 lines? Which would have the same effect. I assume there's some reason these lines exist?

```py3
# update outstanding
source.payment_schedule = []
if source.payment_schedule and len(source.payment_schedule) == 1:
	target.overdue_payments[0].outstanding = source.get(""outstanding_amount"")
```

Nihantra-Patel (Issue Creator) on (2024-08-12 10:29:40 UTC): Lines you had were clearing out `source.payment_schedule` and handling only the case when there was just one payment schedule. This caused issues because you were losing data. Removing those lines helps to keep all the payment schedules and process them correctly. 

So, instead of clearing `source.payment_schedule` and only checking for one payment schedule, just make sure you add all overdue payments to the `target` and keep everything as it is. This way, you don't miss any data and everything works as expected.

daanlenaerts on (2024-08-12 11:32:19 UTC): Thank you for your quick reply @Nihantra-Patel. That makes sense! And why did you keep the if statement? The condition is always false, as `len(source.payment_schedule)` is now always 0 due to the line you added?

Nihantra-Patel (Issue Creator) on (2024-08-12 11:36:11 UTC): Since source.payment_schedule is emptied before the check, the if statement will never be true. So, you don't need that if statement at all. Just keep the code that clears old payments and adds new ones to the target. This makes the code simpler and avoids any confusion. please check the video that i provided above.

daanlenaerts on (2024-08-12 11:40:45 UTC): Absolutely, that's my point :D The if statement is still present in your code, so it might be good to remove those lines to keep things clean. I would do it, but can't really because it's your bug fix.

Nihantra-Patel (Issue Creator) on (2024-08-12 11:58:03 UTC): Hmm 🤔 

You said that if you remove/comment out the code below the outstanding will be updated? Did you test it?

I don't think it will be an outstanding update.
```
if source.payment_schedule and len(source.payment_schedule) == 1:
	target.overdue_payments[0].outstanding = source.get(""outstanding_amount"")
```

daanlenaerts on (2024-08-12 12:26:47 UTC): I'm not really saying that, all I'm saying is that the line you added in this fix ensures the if statement never succeeds, effectively rendering it useless. In which case it might be better to remove it.

However, to answer your question, I just tried actually removing the if statement and that does work (as it is effectively the same as your changes, it just makes the code cleaner). The `outstanding` amount is taken directly from the sales invoice's `payment_schedule`.

I do think that this would be an issue when a sales invoice would have multiple payment schedule lines, but I'm not sure when that's the case.

Rational: Accountant booking purchase Invoice should have more control and be not restricted by option chosen by purchase team.

What do you think @ruthra-kumar?

ruthra-kumar (Assginee) on (2024-08-09 07:45:04 UTC): That's a valid point.

But, a document's taxes or grand total or item rates' changing through the cycle (Sales / Purchase) have been the biggest source of issues / customer query on many cases. My concern is this allows for such scenarios easily.

Rounding Entries are unavoidable in high precision Sales / Purchase Invoices that post opening entries. As the default Round off account is of type Profit and Loss, such Invoices is currently not possible to be submitted.

## Solution
A separate Round Off account just for opening entries could help address this issue. This account will be under Liability.

<details>

<summary>Abandoned tasks</summary>

Tasks:
- [x] ~~patch to update existing companies~~
- [x] ~~add round off for all templates in verified and unverified directory~~

</details>

## Alternate approach
Abandoning above approach of updating templates and creating account automatically.

System will not auto-create any accounts. Instead,
- Company master will have new account provision `round_off_for_opening`, which is not mandatory
- New `account_type` - `Round Off for Opening` - is introduced
- User has to manually create an account of above type and set it in company master


ToDo:
- [x] Test cases for Sales Invoice, with and without inclusive tax
- [x] Test case for Purchase Invoice

2443940014,pull_request,closed,,fix : deffered advance version14,"### Causes:
1. We found an anomaly: when the service start date is set at the end of the month (e.g., 30-05-2024 or 31-05-2024), the system fails to create the monthly deferred expense journal.
2. If we change the service start date to 29-05-2024, the amortization recognition journal for the end of May is created with a prorated calculation from 29-05-2024 to 31-05-2024. In the following month (e.g., 30 June), a full month’s expense recognition journal (30 days) is created.
