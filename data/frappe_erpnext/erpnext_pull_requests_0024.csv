2474733529,pull_request,closed,,fix: Create Sales Order from Quotation for Prospect (backport #42379),"**Version:** dev and 15

fixes: #42136

**Before:**

- Suppose we create an opportunity for a prospect without a lead and then create a quotation from the opportunity, then the quotation will be created but when you create a sales order from the quotation, the lead error occurs. Because the opportunity is not connected to the lead. But sometimes it is also a case that when an opportunity is created for a direct prospect, this case fails.


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04190f38-4be3-4258-a533-ce97e994da2f

**After:**

- When creating a sales order from a quotation for a prospect, if the prospect is not a customer, then first create a customer and then create a sales order.

ruthra-kumar (Assginee) on (2024-08-20 05:14:19 UTC): Fixed

ruthra-kumar (Assginee) on (2024-08-20 10:47:48 UTC): @rtdany10 
2 test cases, `test_rounding_adjustment` and `test_sales_invoice_discount_amount`, which were not failing on the original PR is failing here.

Could you take a look?

rtdany10 on (2024-08-20 12:15:06 UTC): @ruthra-kumar 
The test case `test_sales_invoice_discount_amount` has wrong assertion.
On develop, it asserts against 0 as grand total itself is an integer and requires on rounding
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bba2a797-2014-488a-9247-f26d0cde5022)

In v14, the asserting is for -0.01 while the grand total is an integer.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8440b7f4-00ba-44f9-b802-e81d485a4ec3)

But apparently grand_total assertion is failing here. I guess we should correct the test case either way

rtdany10 on (2024-08-20 13:19:38 UTC): ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bca951fe-3c40-4e2f-9d81-8096863dbdb7)
We will have to correct both the test cases.

I believe this can be attributed to the change in rounding functionality between the versions, 14 and develop. 15 and onwards uses ""Banker's Rounding"" while 14 uses ""Banker's Rounding (legacy)""

rtdany10 on (2024-08-20 13:23:46 UTC): I do not have write access to this branch, can you correct the test cases please? @ruthra-kumar

Other suggested implementation of #42279

In France we have chart of account where the same Account number can be use as Liability or as Asset ( the root_type do not exists like that but in France, it imply other definition and meaning but we try to find a way to allow proper French accountancy in ERPNext)

We can understand that add root_type to the check the uniqueness of a Account number may not please all country accountancy rules.
So we can also change the PR to always send root_type as parameters and not use it for standard/core test of uniqueness but add @erpnext.allow_regional on the validate_account_number() function.
Like that we can override it in [ERPNext France](https://github.com/scopen-coop/erpnext_france) app

> Explain the **details** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?

This PR make two changes :

    Use the same method/function on Account creation as on Account update to check the validity of the account number
    Send root_type as parameters to validate_account_number() to check account number uniqueness by company and root_type

The system does correctly pull in the Warehouse from the Sales Order. Given the Stock Reservation Entry (SRE) is made from Sales Order Items and SOI's already have the correct warehouse for each row, the same is copied into Delivery Note item.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bc60aec-0c62-47d7-a341-7b75954e9fe1




The issue you've mentioned, only happens if Sales Order Item's and its SRE's have a different warehouse.But, I'm not clear on how that scenario can happen. Could you provide an example?

2471201935,pull_request,closed,,feat: pseudo-translate fixtures created by setup wizard,"This PR achieves the following goals:

1. Names of fixture records need to be inserted in english because they are hardcoded in many places
2. Names of fixture records should get translated in the UI
3. Names of fixture records should get extracted as translatable strings

The combination of (1) and (3) is achieved by redefining the translation function to return the input unchanged (only for this file). Hence, the strings won't get translated but the extractor can still pick them up.

(2) is achieved by enabling ""Translate Link Fields"" for the respective DocTypes.

- User has created pricing rule that on purchase of 2 quantity of Item A, they will get 1 free quantity of Item A
- User has create a sales order for 2 quantity of Item A, on which 1 free quantity of Item A has added in the SO
- User has created a pick list and he came to know that he has only 2 quantity of Item A available, so he has removed free item
- User has created Delivery Note and system has added 1 free item automatically which ideally was not picked

Added option in the pick list to Ignore the pricing rule

2464019084,pull_request,closed,,fix: linkage between asset repair and asset value adjustment (backport #42719),"This PR consist of following fixes:

1. **Asset Value Adjustment and Depreciation Recalculation After Asset Repair:**

- Issue: When an asset with existing depreciation undergoes an Asset Value Adjustment (increasing its value), followed by an Asset Repair, the system:

> - As expected cancels previous depreciation entries.
> - But recalculates the depreciation schedule using the initial asset value instead of the adjusted value.
> - Ignores already booked depreciation entries, recalculating based on the original depreciation period.

2. **Canceling Asset Repair or Asset Value Adjustment:**

- Issue: When canceling:
> - An Asset Repair, the system reverts to the initial asset value in the depreciation schedule, ignoring the adjusted value.
> - Similarly when cancelling an ""Asset Value Adjustment"", it just consider the asset value as given in the Current Asset Value field present in the form but ignores if value has been changed after that adjustment through asset repair.<hr>This is an automatic backport of pull request #42719 done by [Mergify](https://mergify.com).",mergify[bot],2024-08-13 19:01:04+00:00,['khushi8112'],2024-08-30 00:10:54+00:00,2024-08-14 05:53:33+00:00,https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/42759,"[('released', None)]","[{'comment_id': 2288099809, 'issue_id': 2464019084, 'author': 'frappe-pr-bot', 'body': ':tada: This issue has been resolved in version 15.33.0 :tada:\n\nThe release is available on [GitHub release](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/releases/tag/v15.33.0)\n\nYour **[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)** bot :package::rocket:', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2024, 8, 14, 8, 2, 48, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)}]","frappe-pr-bot on (2024-08-14 08:02:48 UTC): :tada: This issue has been resolved in version 15.33.0 :tada:

2463042595,pull_request,closed,,fix: Force Fetching updates on Subscriptions (backport #42221),"# Issue
Post [this](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/30963) refactor, `Fetch Subscription Updates` creates Invoices only if the Current Invoice Start / End date matches the current date. For old subscriptions, this also resets these values to the current periods' start and end dates without creating any pending invoices.

Consider the below subscription,

|||
|-|-|
|Subscription Start Date| 1st Jan|
|Subscription End Date|31 Dec|
|Plan Interval|1 Month|

and current date is 2nd March

When 'Fetch Subscription Updates' is triggered,
### Current behavior:
No Invoices are created for Jan and Feb and `current_invoice_start` and `current_invoice_end` date are updated to the latest month - March

### Expected behavior:
Invoice for January should be created and the `current_invoice_start` and `current_invoice_end` should be updated to February. Upon triggering 'Fetch Subscription Updated' again, the same should happen for February. Triggering it again, should not create any invoices as the current period - March, is not over.

# Fix
Adding a new Action button `Force-Fetch Subscription Updates`. This will have the expected behavior stated above, without allowing the scheduled job to create invoices for old subscriptions on its own.

mohsinalimat on (2024-09-18 05:28:07 UTC): @vorasmit @deepeshgarg007 @ruthra-kumar Any updates regarding this PR? We have same issue in Sales Invoice and Payment Entry.

vorasmit (Issue Creator) on (2024-09-19 01:39:34 UTC): @mohsinalimat,

This solution is only for cases where a company is responsible for deducting TDS/TCS in Purchase/Sales Invoice.

This will not work where TDS is deducted from the companies Invoice by customer.
Refer: https://support.frappe.io/helpdesk/tickets/20034

mohsinalimat on (2024-09-19 02:01:16 UTC): @vorasmit Then what is the solution for this?

vorasmit (Issue Creator) on (2024-09-19 02:11:16 UTC): In addition to changes in this PR for Payment Entry, following additional changes may be required:

In Payment Entry => In references table, we'll have to allow deductions against each invoice somehow.

This is complex as it may need to be handled at multiple places, including Advances table in Sales Invoice or Payment Reconciliation.

sjain17 on (2024-09-23 10:55:21 UTC): When this will be merged into Version-15?

vorasmit (Issue Creator) on (2024-11-08 08:41:00 UTC): Similar implementation was not required in Sales Invoice and Payment Entry.

For Sales Invoice, if TCS is charged, it goes as a part of Sales Invoice to customer and he can match with the total amount of Invoice.

For Payment Entry, print format is comprehensive, and gives breakup of TDS.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1065453d-abd5-4271-ab2d-fbd8f452d072)

Hence existing implementation for Purchase Invoice looks sufficient.

2460268871,pull_request,closed,,fix: linkage between asset repair and asset value adjustment,"This PR consist of following fixes:

1. **Asset Value Adjustment and Depreciation Recalculation After Asset Repair:**

- Issue: When an asset with existing depreciation undergoes an Asset Value Adjustment (increasing its value), followed by an Asset Repair, the system:

> - As expected cancels previous depreciation entries.
> - But recalculates the depreciation schedule using the initial asset value instead of the adjusted value.
> - Ignores already booked depreciation entries, recalculating based on the original depreciation period.

2. **Canceling Asset Repair or Asset Value Adjustment:**

- Issue: When canceling:
> - An Asset Repair, the system reverts to the initial asset value in the depreciation schedule, ignoring the adjusted value.
> - Similarly when cancelling an ""Asset Value Adjustment"", it just consider the asset value as given in the Current Asset Value field present in the form but ignores if value has been changed after that adjustment through asset repair.",khushi8112,2024-08-12 07:44:08+00:00,[],2024-08-30 00:11:11+00:00,2024-08-13 19:00:04+00:00,https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/42719,"[('assets', ''), ('backport version-15-hotfix', '')]",[],
