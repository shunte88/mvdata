2593787453,pull_request,closed,,feat: Ledger for advance payment,"# Issue
System allows advance payment to exceed Sales / Purchase Order grand total.

Consider below scenario,
1. Sales Order of 10000 /-
2. Make an Advance Payment of 2000 /-
3. Make a Partial Invoice (2000 /-) for Sales Order and Reconcile the advance against the invoice
4. Now, try making an Advance payment of 10000 /-. System allows this. It should've only allowed up to 8000 /-



# Current Limitation
This happens because technically there is no distinction between a Normal Payment and an Advance Payment. So there is no persistent data structure to track the Advance Amount received for a Sales / Purchase Order. This distinction is inferred solely based on the allocation. If the Payment is allocated to a Sales / Purchase Order, then it is considered as an Advance Payment.

The problem with this approach is once reconciliation happens, the allocation to Sales / Purchase Order are replaced with an Invoice. So, we loose the critical information: **A certain amount was received as an Advance, but it is now allocated to an Invoice.**

# Solution
A separate ledger to track Advance Payments against Sales Order or Purchase Order that only captures Submit and Cancel events. This way Reconciliation / Un-Reconciliation doesn't affect the advance amount calculation.

|Event| Ledger Effect|
|-|-|
|Submit| Update|
|Reconcile|-|

|Cancel|Update|

vorasmit on (2024-10-22 14:13:20 UTC): Just saw this:

This issue will mainly arise for webshop or customer portal, integrated with payment gateway.
A setting for this may not be necessary.

Suggestion:

In my opinion, 
- introduce a status to payment request for invalidating the payment link if already generated (say Invalid). This may involve invalidating payment gateway order too, so that customers cannot pay using old links.
- when this is created from portal, invalidate old requests and create a new one.
- ensure payment entries cannot be created from invalidated payment requests.

Should these fields be hidden in the Purchase Invoice as well? Also, do we need to patch the existing table?

Multiple Child company accounts were not included in the consolidated balance sheet because while accounts were filtered on the basis of account_key which is account_name or account_name + account_number but parents were filtered based on name.

Solution:

Filter accounts based on the account_key created for the parent which is `parent_account_name`.

Notes:
- If there are two same account names but different parent then the group for both will be as per parent company.

2587773101,pull_request,closed,,fix: missing child company accounts in consolidated balance sheet,"Issue:

Multiple Child company accounts were not included in the consolidated balance sheet because while accounts were filtered on the basis of account_key which is account_name or account_name + account_number but parents were filtered based on name.

Solution:

Filter accounts based on the account_key created for the parent which is `parent_account_name`.

Notes:
- If there are two same account names but different parent then the group for both will be as per parent company.

vv-varun (Issue Creator) on (2024-11-14 06:46:21 UTC): @ruthra-kumar  - I tested it in TEST and PROD systems both.
Our PROD runs on dedicated Frappe Cloud Server.

1. Enable `Book Advance Payments in Separate Party Account`
2. Make Purchase Order
3. Make Payment against Purchase Order
4. Make Purchase Invoice for Purchase Order and reconcile advance against this invoice using Reconciliation tool

Advance Payment shows up under 'Invoices' section in Payment Reconciliation tool.

# Root cause

### GL entries for Advance payment
|Account| Debit|Credit|Voucher No| Against Voucher|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Advance Paid|1000|0|ACC-PAY-2024-00012|PUR-ORD-2024-0001|
|Cash|0|1000|ACC-PAY-2024-00012||

`against_voucher` field is referring Purchase Order.

### Upon reconciliation
|Account| Debit|Credit|Voucher No| Against Voucher|-|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Advance Paid|1000|0|ACC-PAY-2024-00012|PUR-ORD-2024-0001|<-|
|Cash|0|1000|ACC-PAY-2024-00012||
|Advance Paid|0|1000|ACC-PAY-2024-00012|ACC-PAY-2024-00012|<-|
|Creditors|1000|0|ACC-PAY-2024-00012|ACC-PINV-2024-00055|

For `Advance Paid` account, `Against Voucher` is still referencing Purchase Order. This cause it to be incorrectly identified as an Invoice.

For a normal Payment, since the amount stays within the same account, this wasn't an issue. But for Advance Payments (`Book Advance Payments in Separate Party Account`), amount moves from one account to another upon reconciliation. But, during this original two rows are untouched.


# Fix
For Payment Entries, don't post references to Sales / Purchase Order in Ledger, as they anyways have no impact on Ledger. 

## Todo
 - [x] Test Cases for Journal / Payment with references to multiple SO / PO
 - [x] Test Unreconciliation along with `Advance as a Liability` enabled.

2583596451,pull_request,closed,,fix: reconciled advance from reported in reconciliation tool (backport #43627),"# Issue

1. Enable `Book Advance Payments in Separate Party Account`
2. Make Purchase Order
3. Make Payment against Purchase Order
4. Make Purchase Invoice for Purchase Order and reconcile advance against this invoice using Reconciliation tool

Advance Payment shows up under 'Invoices' section in Payment Reconciliation tool.

# Root cause

### GL entries for Advance payment
|Account| Debit|Credit|Voucher No| Against Voucher|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Advance Paid|1000|0|ACC-PAY-2024-00012|PUR-ORD-2024-0001|
|Cash|0|1000|ACC-PAY-2024-00012||

`against_voucher` field is referring Purchase Order.

### Upon reconciliation
|Account| Debit|Credit|Voucher No| Against Voucher|-|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Advance Paid|1000|0|ACC-PAY-2024-00012|PUR-ORD-2024-0001|<-|
|Cash|0|1000|ACC-PAY-2024-00012||
|Advance Paid|0|1000|ACC-PAY-2024-00012|ACC-PAY-2024-00012|<-|
|Creditors|1000|0|ACC-PAY-2024-00012|ACC-PINV-2024-00055|

For `Advance Paid` account, `Against Voucher` is still referencing Purchase Order. This cause it to be incorrectly identified as an Invoice.

For a normal Payment, since the amount stays within the same account, this wasn't an issue. But for Advance Payments (`Book Advance Payments in Separate Party Account`), amount moves from one account to another upon reconciliation. But, during this original two rows are untouched.


# Fix
For Payment Entries, don't post references to Sales / Purchase Order in Ledger, as they anyways have no impact on Ledger. 

## Todo
 - [x] Test Cases for Journal / Payment with references to multiple SO / PO
 - [x] Test Unreconciliation along with `Advance as a Liability` enabled.
