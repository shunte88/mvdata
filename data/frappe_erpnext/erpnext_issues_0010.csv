2279586225,issue,open,,POS CLOSING ENTRY: Can refer row only if the charge type is 'On Previous Row Amount' or 'Previous Row Total',"### Information about bug

This error appears when you try submitting the POS Closing. Even tho the charge type is on 'Previous Row Total' with reference set to 1, it does still give this error. The error only stops when there is no charge type field which is 'On Previous Row Amount' or 'Previous Row Total' is selected within the rows in the Sales and Taxes Template doctype. but once you try and added such a charge type and input a reference number then when submitting in the POS Closing Entry, you end up with that error.

This error is visible in version 14 and 15 and it prevents me from submitting pos closing entry in order to create sales invoices.

2276266918,issue,closed,completed,Purchase Order Item filter on Supplier not working,"### Information about bug

In Purchase Order, after selecting a Supplier, when clicking in the Purchase Order Item table's Item Code cell, the list of items appear in a drop down, but the items listed are the same as if no supplier was selected earlier.

Another user has reported this in https://discuss.frappe.io/t/purchase-order-supplier-not-filtering-on-item-code/102758 and I have reproduced the issue.

geraldleungontario (Issue Creator) on (2024-05-03 15:49:10 UTC): This works in certain scenarios, but fails in others..

The closest matching behaviour appears to be this:
Party Type: Supplier
Party Name: <supplier name>
Restrict Items Based On: Item Group
Based On Value: <item group of the item under that supplier>

The scenario that causes this to fail is this:
Supplier, Item Group, Item
Sanitizing Company, Sanitizing Stuff, Hand Sanitizer
Cleaning Company, Sanitizing Stuff, 99% Alcohol

In this scenario, I would set up 2 Party Specific Item. When creating the Purchase Order, I would put Sanitizing Company as the Supplier, then the Purchase Order Item's Item Code cell would list both of these items from the 2 suppliers as possible choices because the filter is based on Item Group.

kunhimohamed on (2024-05-04 07:17:38 UTC): you can manage using an item group.

Nihantra-Patel on (2024-05-06 09:53:01 UTC): You can apply only one threshold at a time if you set up an item for one supplier, then you cannot set up an item group with the same supplier, and If you add, then the item will appear, which is common from both conditions.

The product bundle valuation is calculated without considering the `qty` of the child item in the bundle.

In the above, the valuation of dining table should be: `4*3,000` + `1*500` = `12,500` and not `3,500`

2275211571,issue,open,,Option to create Material Request for Subcontracting,"Currently, on the submission of a Production Plan with raw materials with Manufacturing Type: Subcontracting, a Purchase Order gets created.
The system should be configured to create a Material Request (MR) for subcontracting, enabling the relevant team to issue Subcontracting Purchase Orders (POs) as and when required.

Reasons:

1. Subcontracting items will be sent to various vendors, not just one. Even if items are sent to the same vendor, they will not be sent on the same day.
2. Currently, only one PO is created at a time.
3. The automatic creation of POs does not allow the selection of the series for the transaction number; it defaults to the standard PO series.
4. Customers need to distinguish subcontracting transactions as Work Orders.

It goes against best practices to use the Journal Entry for recording ordinary expenses; the recommended approach is to use non-inventoriable item(s). I'm not saying that this feature shouldn't be developed, but I don't agree with the premise that it would be good to have this feature to ""allow users to record deferred expenses directly in the Journal Entry"".

ernestoruiz89 (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-29 20:09:55 UTC): Hello,  

Many accountants are accustomed to traditional accounting practices where journal entries are the primary method for recording all financial transactions, rather than using the entire ERP system

Companies sometimes need to make accrual adjustments that are not directly linked to any purchase or sales invoice, like adjustments, a company may need to defer the recognition of revenue received in advance for a service that will be delivered over several months. This type of adjustment may not always align neatly with the transactions recorded via invoices.

Also, handling the opening of accounts via journal entries that include balances of deferred expenses or revenues.

This feature could be enabled in the accounting settings and not be set as default.

 I understand your concerns about using journal entries for recording ordinary expenses in ERPNext, given its focus on inventory management. It’s clear that for accurate financial reporting and inventory tracking, adhering to best practices is crucial. 

However, for non-inventory related transactions or complex financial environments, some flexibility in recording methods might still be necessary.

I understand your strong stance against implementing the feature, it might be beneficial to have a configurable option, as suggested, where such features are not default but available for activation based on specific accounting needs or contexts. This could provide the necessary flexibility for businesses with unique requirements without altering the standard practices recommended for most users.

I've shared a suggestion:
If you've installed ERPNext in version 15, make sure the hrms is also in version 15 to prevent errors.

If the hrms is in the development branch, switch to it:

```bash
bench switch-to-branch version-15 hrms
```

If you've uninstalled or installed the app, do this:

```bash
bench get-app --branch version-15 hrms
```

This is because the hrms app has a version 15 branch.

I hope this is clear and helpful.

2265648231,issue,closed,completed,Include descendant accounts during accounting dimension validation,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
During GL Entry creation, the system validates the applied account against the allowed accounting dimensions. This works well for non-group accounts, but if a group account is provided, the system should validate against all descendant accounts as well.

The following code runs the validation of the GL Entry account against applicable individual accounts:

However, step #2 is not possible. In my ""Fetch From"" field, I get a dropdown selector (screenshot below) and can only choose from the list of Doc Type. In that documentation example, would that mean you would have to create a Doc Type for GSTIN, and define GSTIN in Supplier as a Link to the GSTIN Doc Type, then you can choose GSTIN from the ""Fetch From"" field in step 3?

2260446337,issue,closed,completed,Issue on fetching exchange rate when making sales order from purchase order,"## Step to reproduce the issue:
1. Create a Purchase Order from an existing Sales Order. The Sales Order currency is in IDR, but the Purchase Order currency is in USD.

## Observed result:
1. The exchange rate in PO is not fetched automatically. It shows 1 instead of the correct rate (around 16000)
2. The currency for PO items remains unchanged, not switching to USD.
3. The last PO Item has 0 item price even though there is an item price for that Item

## Expected result:
1. The exchange rate should be fetched automatically when creating a purchase order from a sales order.
2. The currency for items should switch to USD in line with the currency conversion.
3. All items should display their correct prices as per the defined item prices.

2259914640,issue,open,,Bug in Consolidated financial statement,"### Information about bug

It seems that this commit beside fixes, introduced some bug as well: 

https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/commit/ae613008be59334e5ff72882ef9d70355f56805e

I will explain. 

E.g. 
setup parent and child company. 
delete 1 account from the parent, but leave the same in the child. 

This method ```validate_entries``` will  correct this problem  successfully. However, it can't since the method ```get_accounts``` now returns accounts from all the companies wherever it finds, but it returns not correctly. So 'it lies' that account is there to the ```validate_entries``` method, but unfortunately it is useless account, an then the balance sheet from that side where deleted account comes from is not generated at all. 

One solution will be adding a ```break``` statement in the for loop in ```get_accounts``` after the first company (main parent) is passed by. I haven't validate whether this will work on more complex structure of companies, but seems it might.

3. In Invoice Creation grid, we have option for providing 2 dates one is for Posting Date and another one for Due Date. In the case of opening invoices, they might already have fallen due before start date of migration to ERPNext. For example, our client decided to migrate to ERPNext on 01-01-2024. They have some customer invoices which have fallen due before 01-01-2024, but ERPNext does not allow to enter any date which is before 01-01-2024. Due to this, we are facing following issues: 1. Aging cannot be calculated properly, report shows wrong information. 2. Due date shown by the report is not correct.

Inbuilt variable for fiscal year is illogical compared to the warning given by the system regarding limitation of numbers for GST. I feel .FY. should be in 2 digit year form.

The system itself previews generating invoice numbers as 19 digits if one simply puts SINV-.FY. as the format whereas the warning on the top says maximum 16 allowed in GST. If we try to combine with fields or more customised naming, the variable .FY. leaves no room for any other variables or fields.

When you create a fiscal year, then define in a small word like (2425).

Bug was introduced here: 

https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/commit/dbf7a479b66bc31890b4a957564c7dfdfad49517

on line 114. 

Later (in the next loop iteration) an exception is thrown on line 58, as bank_ac_no is not known field in the table `tabBank Account`. There it is called `bank_account_no`. So, either in employee table/doctype this should be changed to `bank_account_no`, instead of `bank_ac_no`, and in that case this code / this line will not be needed, or, `or_filters` here should be copied or reverted back after checking on Employee. This is in a loop, where it happens Employee not to be the last always to be checked.

part of the exception thrown is as follows: 

``` ""pymysql.err.OperationalError: (1054, ""Unknown column 'tabBank Account.bank_ac_no' in 'where clause'"")"" ```

2254699309,issue,closed,completed,[BUG] [DOCUMENTATION] Unable to disable/hide unused apps,"### Information about bug

We are trying to hide/disable all the applications we don't need for our small company.

We followed the current [documentation](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/show-hide-modules) but the current home does not have such a feature.

[This documentation](https://github.com/frappe/manual_erpnext_com/blob/master/manual_erpnext_com/www/contents/customize-erpnext/hiding-modules-and-features.md) is also outdated.

Also, we don't find any valid documentation about disabling unused applications since `bench` does not work for production.

What should we do?

Does Frappe have plans to update the documentation soon?

**Scenario:**
I am able to add a supplier quotation without checking if the quotation actually fulfils my order. Let's say I have ordered 20 cameras and 40 batteries. There are 15 suppliers who can fill in their prices.

**There are 2 important validations/notifications we should have:**
- Some suppliers don't have all the items in the request list, and fill in partial items, say only cameras.
- Supplier only fills in 15 cameras instead of 20, say due to stock shortage.

2249862745,issue,closed,completed,Issues with Item Tax Rate,"## Introduction

Item tax rate is a field that's updated in items table (eg: Sales Invoice Item) and used to update total taxes.

**Workflow**: Item Tax Template => Updates Item Tax Rate => Updates Final Taxes.

Hence it's crucial to ensure Item tax template and Item tax rate are consistent.

eg: Item Tax Rate:
{""Output Tax SGST - RT"": 6.0, ""Output Tax CGST - RT"": 6.0, ""Output Tax IGST - RT"": 12.0, ""Input Tax SGST - RT"": 6.0, ""Input Tax CGST - RT"": 6.0, ""Input Tax IGST - RT"": 12.0, ""Input Tax SGST RCM - RT"": 6.0, ""Input Tax CGST RCM - RT"": 6.0, ""Input Tax IGST RCM - RT"": 12.0}

## Issues

We found following two cases where it's inconsistent.

### Item tax rate is only updated in UI and not backend.

Reference: Function: [get_item_tax_info](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/develop/erpnext/stock/get_item_details.py#L520)

This causes issues when trying to use data import tool to import transactions.

### Item tax rate is set even after Item Tax Template is removed

Steps on how to replicate this issue
- Create one item with only one item tax template
- Create a transaction for this item. This should auto-fetch item tax template.
- Unset item tax template from the item. Save

With unset, it doesn't unset item tax rate, causing incorrect final taxes.

2249541629,issue,open,,Expected Delivery Date on Purchase Order (Parent) DocType ,"In the Purchase Order parent DocType, we already have a Required By field from where the Purchase Order Item child table fetches the value for Required By value for each item, eliminating the repetitive task of having to enter this required date for each item.

Since we also have an Expected Delivery Date field in the child table, we should also have this same field with the same functionality in the parent document. 

Currently we have to add these manually one by one and when there are many items in the Purchase Order, it is quite frustrating for our purchase users.

Hi,

We have a stock report which we export manually 3 times a day. Recently it seems that the CSV export settings have changed so that ‘CSV quoting’ is set to ‘Non-Numeric’ (Screenshot attached). Is there a way to change this so that the default is set to ‘minimal’ as it is messing up with imports we use on another system.

Thanks,
Liam

dineshpanchal93 (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-17 13:37:58 UTC): @Nihantra-Patel I know its working fine my end as well

If I set the new site with no data and having less data it worked fine

But if the report is too lengthy and anyone is migrated from v14 to v15 these problems arrives

I hope you can have a look into it.

Nihantra-Patel on (2024-04-17 13:47:31 UTC): Also, I tried with a general ledger and a stock ledger because, as you know, ledgers have a lot of data, but we haven't found the issue. and after your first message, i migrated the v14 data to v15, so no issue was found. but i will try multiple ways; if I find anything, then will update you.

dineshpanchal93 (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-17 14:05:41 UTC): Sure thanks !!!

dineshpanchal93 (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-17 14:09:34 UTC): I tried with updating the latest version

if you can find anything in below attached video even I am confusing

https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/assets/21578167/002366b6-91b7-4b0a-a748-34000178df13

I tried all settings somewhere i am wrong.

Nihantra-Patel on (2024-04-17 14:19:12 UTC): 😅 This also occurs in version 14 and 15 if there is a lot of data, making it necessary to prepare data without generating a report. It's a common occurrence, which is why the Prepared Report feature is provided. When users generate a report, they can easily check it without wasting time.

For instance, if you have 5 years of data stored in the system and you disable the prepare report option, the report will take approximately 3-4 minutes to generate. However, if you enable the prepare report option, you first set the filters and generate the report, saving around 80% of your time.

hope this helps! 😉

dineshpanchal93 (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-17 15:48:41 UTC): @Nihantra-Patel  I See.

This same data I have in v14 as well I won't get any auto option for the generate report. but anyway, we need to find some different solutions. if I have anything, I will let you know.

Thank you so much for getting back to me so quickly.

This is the serial number document showing warrant expiry and warranty period details. this was created before your serial number and batch bundle option. V14.

This system was pretty good. 
It has serial number creating document link. 
 as well as despatch document details. whether it may be delivery note or sales invoice. 
 
 is there any option to go back to that previous system, 
 
 Because at a glance we can see from the serial number doc 
 1) warranty expiry details
 2) who is the customer

2) based on the delivery documents like Delivery note or sales invoice.

sapl-santhosh (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-18 11:00:42 UTC): for your additional information in V14. 
we used to create a warranty certificate print template from this serial number doc which has

Serial No. 
Item name and description
Customer name (fetched from the despatch document details)
warranty expiry date.

and below we  have some bla bla bla terms and conditions of warranty.  and use this to send customer as warranty certificate. 

we are missing this in V15

Nihantra-Patel on (2024-04-19 06:41:54 UTC): Hi @sapl-santhosh,

First thing, serial no doctype has no customer field, so how do we set filters without customers? It's a logical thing.

sapl-santhosh (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-19 09:16:45 UTC): ![Screenshot 2024-04-19 144107](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/assets/109452795/0afce678-6c3e-4211-a8e7-83fcd0637a8a)

this is screenshot from v14 serial no doctype. 
After that particular serial number has been used in a delivery note. 

it auto populates the customer name, also fills the warranty details.  
So I hope in the warranty claim document, after a customer name is selected the serial numbers can be filtered to match what all serial numbers that customer has purchased.

Nihantra-Patel on (2024-04-19 09:18:26 UTC): V14 and v15 have different functionality now, please check the serial doctype in v15. Lots of features have been changed.

sapl-santhosh (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-19 09:28:39 UTC): if you come across similiar type of requirement from someone. kindly try to add this feature. 

workflow will be 
1) first we open a issue of a customer from their email manually. (Issue doc type)
2) then if there is a product issue. we raise a warranty claim
3) so from issues doc, we create a warranty claim. In that when we select customer name, based on that if the serial nos are populated it will be easy for a support agent to choose it. 

as I now create a V14 site and checked. The serial doctype is fetching the customer name after a delivery note. But in the warranty claim doctype the serial number is not filtering out based on customer name. 

either its v14 or v15. if this feature was there. it will be useful.

Nihantra-Patel on (2024-04-19 09:34:17 UTC): Certain functionalities can be carried forward to the upper version because maintaining the document store or other details might be cumbersome, so they cannot be backported to v14. I understand the challenges you're facing, but it was removed in v15 due to the new feature of [Serial and Batch Bundle] (https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/serial-and-batch-bundle).

hope you understand.

sapl-santhosh (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-23 06:58:42 UTC): Even when serial number of the product sold to that customer is selected in the serial number field it is not populating the Item code and other details. Also put up a error related to delivery date field.

3. tried it on version 14 and version 15

Available options:
Periodical Inventory

Things could help:

2247148866,issue,open,,In accounts there is one requirement on bank account mapping with general ledger.,"Hi Team,

We are facing below issue

In accounts there is one requirement on bank account mapping with general ledger.

on the linkage of multiple Bank Account masters with a single GL ledger following are the observations

Problem Statement: Need  to have multiple Bank Accounts Linked to a single Ledger for Bank account.

ERPNext Standard Functionality:
ERPNext allows only a single ledger to be linked at a time with a Bank Account Master.
Reference of error is as follows:
![Screenshot from 2024-04-17 07-11-01](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/assets/4947418/8e55b184-621c-47bb-b88e-ba991c06c038)
Reason & Logic behind the above:
For a system it needs a dedicated ledger account to track all the transactions for a particular bank account. So that while reconciliation we get dedicated closing and opening balances of a Bank Account. Which is as per the standard practices.

 Reference of reason is as follows:
![image](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/assets/4947418/1c640cad-5b92-4b9e-8356-c879ef85c011)
Possible workarounds/Customisations:

1) Workaround:

We need to create a Parent Ledger as a Savings Bank Account and inside that all Bank Account Master will have a dedicated Ledger account linked to that Bank Account.

2) Customisations:
Condition: We have to compromise the Bank Reconciliation Feature in ERP Next so that we cannot use that.

Can you please check with all the above issue and do the needful .

Do let me know if you have any questions or need any type of information.

Thank You,

Pallavi Surwase

Even if I set the billing_amount to 0 in Timesheet Detail (e.g. via Client Script - for internal projects) the total_billing_amount in the referenced task and project is not 0.

It seems that the the field Task.total_billing_amount is ignored and always calculated based on the Timesheet Detail.billing_hours * Actitity Type.billing_rate.

When I select an acitivity type that has a billing_rate of 0 it works as expected.


Steps to reproduce:

1. Create Projekt
2. Create Task for Project
3. Create Actitiy Type with billing_rate > 0
4. Create Timesheet
5. Create Timesheet Detail entry with created Activity Type, Task and Project - e.g. 1h
6. Select is_billable
7. Set the billing_rate to 0
8. Save & Submit
9. Check Created Task -> total_billing_amount: Expected 0, But is > 0
10. Check Created Project -> total_billable_amount: Expected 9, But is > 0

As per the documentation of ERPNext (URL mentioned below):-
""The stock and accounting entries are now created at the end of day while closing a POS session by a **single sales invoice which merges all the intermediate invoices created throughout the day**"";
each of these 'intermediate invoices' (logged in the POS Invoice ""sub-ledger""), updates the ""Reserved for POS Transactions"" column in the ""Stock Projected Quantity Report"" - which are then consolidated as a single 'Sales Invoice', after you create the 'POS closing entry'.

Hence the ERPNext POS will not generate a separate 'Sales Incoice' for each 'POS Invoice'; instead it will consolidate the 'POS Invoices' logged between a ""POS Opening Entry"" and a ""POS Closing Entry""

Reference:
https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/pos_invoice_consolidation


@nabinhait

yogeshvachhani (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-18 06:45:32 UTC): Thanks for the clarification.

But the Qty reported by POS is different then that of `Stock Balance` and `Stock Ledger`. It is generally less the what is reported by Stock reports.

To test further...

We manually created Sales Invoices for all those POS Invoices which were not related to Sales Invoice to check and found that after we created necessary Sales Invoices the Qty reported by POS was the same as that reported by `Stock Balance` and `Stock Ledger`.

Why is this happening?

karanwilson on (2024-04-18 07:34:47 UTC): Yes, as per the documentation: when you create a ""POS Opening Entry"", the POS will reserve some QTY out of the ""Actual QTY"", in a column called ""Reserved for POS Transactions"", within the ""Stock Projected Quantity Report"".

Hence the POS QTY (""Reserved for POS Transactions"") will be less than the ""Actualy QTY"" - either until you create a ""POS Closing Entry"" (which creates a consolidated Sales Invoice), or if you manually create a separate 'Sales Invoice' before closing the POS (note that after closing the POS, the consolidated Sales Invoice will again reduce the QTY as per the logged POS Invoice).

You can read this document in detail, to understand this process well:-
https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/pos_invoice_consolidation

However, as long as your accounts and stock ledgers are in order, after the POS is closed, you do not need to worry about the internals of this process - it was designed to make the POS transactions faster.

@nabinhait

yogeshvachhani (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-18 07:50:30 UTC): Thanks for the clarification.

This means one will have to set the POS Profile to not Validate Stock.

![image](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/assets/109499572/b19991c3-107a-47b8-8bd9-204abee97c91)
Because if this is setting is active POS does not allow to add an item which is zero (0).

karanwilson on (2024-04-18 08:59:10 UTC): Hi Yogesh, I just verified from the code that if you check ""Validade Stock on Save"" in the POS profile, ERPNext will check stock against the QTY that is reserved for POS; So this setting works as per the POS consolidation design discussed above.

Further, in case you wish to add an item in the POS cart, which has zero QTY - you will need to enable the option ""Allow Negative Stock"" in the ""Stock Validations"" tab of the ""Stock Settings"" page - attaching a screenshot for this.

@nabinhait

yogeshvachhani (Issue Creator) on (2024-04-19 14:55:59 UTC): Ok understood.

Will try to setup the whole thing as per the documentation suggested.

Thanks a lot.

2245673295,issue,closed,completed,Stock Entry Submitted Document is still in Draft stage,"### Information about bug

Hello,

![dH0vcSA](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/assets/167191848/87b6086c-2d40-4867-9941-4f9bbde81f65)

As you can see in the image above, this warning comes when we submit the stock entry The status is changed to submitted, and workflow that were in pending approval will go to an approved state. But as the warning mentions, the task is running in the background, and if the stock entry runs at some error, it will revert the stock entry status back to draft, which it does, but the workflow state will remain in the approved state. So i think it should also go back to approval pending state as well.

Thanks & Regards
