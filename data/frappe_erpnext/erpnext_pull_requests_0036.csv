2255028271,pull_request,closed,,fix: budget validation for purchase orders (backport #40769),"### Bug

Validation for budget fails even though the actual expense in Purchase Orders is less than the budget amount.

When the `get_amount` function is called for getting the expenses that will occur through Purchase Orders, the actual expense for purchase invoices is added once.

https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/8e522183bc417b52253315cd3784a125eea671d8/erpnext/accounts/doctype/budget/budget.py#L302-L311

However, when validation runs, the actual expense is added again to the total amount to compare against the budget amount.

https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/8e522183bc417b52253315cd3784a125eea671d8/erpnext/accounts/doctype/budget/budget.py#L252-L256

<hr>

### Fix 

- Add expense amount only once to the total expense before validating against the budget amount.
- Show breakup of expenses booked through Actual Expenses, Material Requests, Unbilled Orders with links to relevant reports.

2254227719,pull_request,closed,,fix: language in sales transactions,"### Before

![before](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/assets/14891507/fdbbb162-f225-4596-9ae8-270d6a15567f)

Not sure why this was a ""Data"" type field. But since it's read-only, all existing data should be valid language codes that have been fetched from the customer or previous doc. So we can safely change the field type to ""Link"".

I've checked with data going five years back, if any broken links exist by chance.

**Before:** 

- When choosing ""quotation_to"" as a customer, the customer displays correctly. Similarly, when selecting ""quotation_to"" as the lead, the lead displays correctly. However, when ""quotation_to"" is set as a prospect, the lead list is shown instead. Moreover, when initially selecting ""quotation_to"" as a customer and then changing it to prospect, it displays properly.

- In the case where ""quotation_to"" is set as a prospect, the address does not appear, and the address filter does not correspond to the prospect; instead, it shows the lead address.

- Sales Invoice has a code that the Sales Order doesn't.

**Before:**
- When there are multiple companies, the company address loads correctly initially. However, if you change the company, the address doesn't update. 

**After:**
- So, we added code that sets the default address for the company when the user changes it. This ensures that the correct company address is displayed.
