vorasmit on (2024-07-10 10:07:31 UTC): I faced this same issue today. In my opinion, creation of additional Journal Entry should be avoided if possible on payment reconciliation where it's possible. Journal Entry every time to reconcile is overkill.

It created a new journal entry for reconciling invoice with other journal entry in my scenario.

rtdany10 (Issue Creator) on (2024-07-10 10:20:58 UTC): This is very true. Also, we often have a hard time convincing users about these system generated JVs and the impact it brings on the general ledger report. Often customers/suppliers can't compare our statement with their ones cause of these extra entries.

ruthra-kumar (Assginee) on (2024-07-12 08:54:23 UTC): @rtdany10 In the before screenshot, is the Sales Invoice and Return made in company currency or in a foreign currency?

ruthra-kumar (Assginee) on (2024-07-12 08:57:20 UTC): @vorasmit 
That shouldn't be the case. Are the invoice and journal in company currency or foreign currency?

vorasmit on (2024-07-12 09:06:58 UTC): @ruthra-kumar,
I'll dig deeper. Actually it's run programmatically in my case. Thank you for the pointers.

vorasmit on (2024-07-12 09:27:04 UTC): I did a retest and have come up with a way to replicate the issue. Reported here:
https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/issues/42302

rtdany10 (Issue Creator) on (2024-07-12 11:29:46 UTC): In company currency itself.

ruthra-kumar (Assginee) on (2024-07-12 11:54:36 UTC): In that case, that Journal itself looks invalid. It is supposed to have values in Debit and Credit. From the screenshot, it doesn't look like it.

Is this replicable?

rtdany10 (Issue Creator) on (2024-07-12 11:59:35 UTC): The journal has values, but when you tick ""Show Net Value in Party Account"" checkbox in the filters, it will show zero

ruthra-kumar (Assginee) on (2024-08-09 07:18:17 UTC): System generated Credit / Debit Journals are the ones that primarily have net effect of '0'. There is a [new checkbox](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/pull/42597) - 'Ignore System Generated Credit / Debit Notes', added specifically to ignore them on General Ledger, which will handle the above case.

@rtdany10 Do you still need this change?

**Before:** 

- When choosing ""quotation_to"" as a customer, the customer displays correctly. Similarly, when selecting ""quotation_to"" as the lead, the lead displays correctly. However, when ""quotation_to"" is set as a prospect, the lead list is shown instead. Moreover, when initially selecting ""quotation_to"" as a customer and then changing it to prospect, it displays properly.

- In the case where ""quotation_to"" is set as a prospect, the address does not appear, and the address filter does not correspond to the prospect; instead, it shows the lead address.

- Do the material receipt for the above product in 2 batches in same warehouse location. Say 200 qty can be split in 100 qty of one batch and expiry and 100 qty of second batch and expiry.

- Create 1 sales order with 10 quantity and create another sales order with 110 quantity.

- Create picklist for 1st sales order, it will have 10 quantity of batch 1.

- Create another picklist of 2nd sales order, it will show a pop up as “20 units of Item 1 is picked in another pick list” as seen in screenshot below and this pick list will only have 90 qty of batch 1.

2285116839,pull_request,closed,,fix: incorrect qty picked in the pick list,"**Issue**

- Create a product with batch and expiry on.

- Do the material receipt for the above product in 2 batches in same warehouse location. Say 200 qty can be split in 100 qty of one batch and expiry and 100 qty of second batch and expiry.

- Create 1 sales order with 10 quantity and create another sales order with 110 quantity.

- Create picklist for 1st sales order, it will have 10 quantity of batch 1.

- Create another picklist of 2nd sales order, it will show a pop up as “20 units of Item 1 is picked in another pick list” as seen in screenshot below and this pick list will only have 90 qty of batch 1.

2281308575,pull_request,closed,,fix(Item): allow UOM conversion for non-stock items (backport #41267),"### Before

The UOM conversion table was shown only for stock items.

### Problem

UOM conversion is needed for other items as well. It is quite common to trade goods and services in different UOMs while not tracking stock in ERPNext. I think this is common enough to be part of the standard, instead of customizing it on many sites.

### After

The UOM conversion table is always visible.

When a PO is submitted against a SO, the `ordered_qty` gets updated for each item in the SO. However, if items are removed from an already submitted PO using **Update Items**, the `ordered_qty` is not reduced from the linked SO.

2277539524,pull_request,closed,,feat: create variant with/without image,"Earlier, when creating a variant, it was not created with an image. Yes, I understand we can set fields in the item variant setting, but we can't set images in it. But I have created a flexible feature in which when you create a single variant or multiple variants, add a checkbox. If you tick that checkbox, the variant will be created with the image that is in the template of that variant. The purpose of creating this feature was that, as an example, suppose there is a book but the image is the same in all the editions of that book, then why should we upload all the images one by one by opening all the items. And it's a bit of a headache. So in the feature, you can create multiple variants with the same image. There are many other examples in which this feature is useful, like a sofa or a chair, but the image will be the same. Only the size has to be mentioned.
