2801022894,pull_request,closed,,perf: Ignore is_opening column in GL Queries (backport #45327),"`Is Opening` column allows users to add opening entries irrespective of posting date and fiscal year.
This should not ideally be allowed after the balance sheet is frozen for the first fiscal year in the system.

This column is used in all queries for getting opening balance, one more side effect this column has is since the posting date can be any date, the tables cannot be logically partitioned based on the posting date to make queries efficient. Once the user reaches large volume of data in GL Entry, these queries take a lot of time to execute and sometimes more than the report timeout limit.

Added a check to ignore this column in queries, once the user has imported all opening entries with posting date before the date system actually came to use with live entries, this column becomes irrelevant.

This should not ideally be allowed after the balance sheet is frozen for the first fiscal year in the system.

This column is used in all queries for getting opening balance, one more side effect this column has is since the posting date can be any date, the tables cannot be logically partitioned based on the posting date to make queries efficient. Once the user reaches large volume of data in GL Entry, these queries take a lot of time to execute and sometimes more than the report timeout limit.

Added a check to ignore this column in queries, once the user has imported all opening entries with posting date before the date system actually came to use with live entries, this column becomes irrelevant.

2795238440,pull_request,closed,,fix: round off tax withholding amount (backport #45271),"Issue - The TCS Amount is not getting rounded off even though *round_off_tax_amount* is checked when the Charge Type is ""On Net Total"" or  ""On Previous Row Total"".

Steps to Replicate:

- Create a Tax withholding category with ""round_off_tax_amount"" as checked and threshold limit as 1.
- Create a Customer and set the tax withholding category.
- Now create a Sales Invoice. TCS will be deducted as Actual.
- Now create a Second Sales Invoice, TCS will be deducted from the Net Total but the amount will not be rounded off.

Note: Currently it is required only for Sales Invoice(TCS).

2795238252,pull_request,closed,,fix: round off tax withholding amount (backport #45271),"Issue - The TCS Amount is not getting rounded off even though *round_off_tax_amount* is checked when the Charge Type is ""On Net Total"" or  ""On Previous Row Total"".

Steps to Replicate:

- Create a Tax withholding category with ""round_off_tax_amount"" as checked and threshold limit as 1.
- Create a Customer and set the tax withholding category.
- Now create a Sales Invoice. TCS will be deducted as Actual.
- Now create a Second Sales Invoice, TCS will be deducted from the Net Total but the amount will not be rounded off.

Note: Currently it is required only for Sales Invoice(TCS).

When there are errors, a rollback must be performed, but when inserting the contact, ERPNext executes an ""after_insert"" hook event calling the erpnext.telephony.doctype.call_log.call_log.link_existing_conversations method

Steps to Replicate:
- Create a Tax Withholding Category with a limit of 10,000 and rate = 10%.
- Create a supplier with the same Tax Withholding Category.
- Create a Purchase Invoice with an amount of ₹15,000. The expected TDS is ₹1,500 (calculated as ₹15,000 * 10%).
- Change the TDS Account in the Tax Withholding Category.
-  Create another Purchase Invoice with an amount of ₹10,000.

The TDS for the second invoice should be ₹1,000 (calculated as ₹10,000 * 10%). However, due to the current system logic, TDS is recalculated based on the new account change, resulting in a total deduction of ₹2,500 (calculated as (₹15,000 + ₹10,000) * 10%).


Proposed Solution:

- Utilize the ""is_tax_withholding_account"" checkbox in the Purchase Taxes and Charges table to determine if TDS has already been deducted.


Note: This field is only available in Purchase Taxes and Charges Table

2786932529,pull_request,closed,,refactor: allow users to configure interval for Semi-Auto payment reconciliation (backport #45211),"# Limitation
Semi-Auto Payment Reconciliation was hard coded to run every 15 min processing only 5 unique `Process Payment Reconciliation` documents. Initial requirement was to handle small number of parties will large volume of unreconciled invoices.

But, for the inverse scenario - thousands of parties but only a dozen or so unreconciled invoices, this interval and queue size is not ideal.

# Solution
Making Trigger interval and Queue size configurable.

ToDo:
- [x] better field names(?)

If consider_party_ledger_amount is checked in the tax withholding category, the threshold is checked based on grand total of the invoice. But while checking tax_on_excess_amount, again threshold is checked based on the net amount of the invoice and if the threshold has not been breached tds is deducted from the whole amount.

Steps to replicate:
- Create a tax withholding category with cumulative threshold 10,00,000/-  and check tax_on_excess_amount and consider_party_ledger_amount.
- Create a supplier with the above category.
- Create a Purchase invoice with item amount 800000 and add taxes of 80,000.
- Create another Purchase Invoice with item amount 130000.


Before:
TDS will be deducted on 9,30,000 even though tax_on_excess_amount is checked.


Solution:
Do not deduct tax if the threshold has not breached the net amount total.


After: 
Tax will not be deducted because the threshold has not breached the net amount total.
