2542442395,pull_request,closed,,fix: incorrect outstanding on non-pos invoice with write_off_account (backport #43316),"# Issue
`write_off_account` is auto set based on the POS Profile when user marks the Invoice as POS - 'Is Pos' checbox.

When `write_off_account` is set, invoice's Outstanding Amount is not updated. But, if you set and unset 'Is Pos' checkbox, `write_off_account` is still set, due to which the Outstanding Amount field is not updated even though it is a normal invoice.

This is more pronounced in Sales Return (Credit Note), as the outstanding amount is not even updated in draft status due to which it always shows '0', even if 'Update Outstanding for Self' is enabled.

# Fix
If Invoice is not POS, write_off_account will be cleared.

2540035789,pull_request,closed,,fix: incorrect outstanding on non-pos invoice with write_off_account,"# Issue
`write_off_account` is auto set based on the POS Profile when user marks the Invoice as POS - 'Is Pos' checbox.

When `write_off_account` is set, invoice's Outstanding Amount is not updated. But, if you set and unset 'Is Pos' checkbox, `write_off_account` is still set, due to which the Outstanding Amount field is not updated even though it is a normal invoice.

This is more pronounced in Sales Return (Credit Note), as the outstanding amount is not even updated in draft status due to which it always shows '0', even if 'Update Outstanding for Self' is enabled.

# Fix
If Invoice is not POS, write_off_account will be cleared.

2539865532,pull_request,closed,,refactor: use common functionality to validate account number (backport #42842),"> Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request:

In France we have chart of account where the same Account number can be use as Liability or as Asset ( the root_type do not exists like that but in France, it imply other definition and meaning but we try to find a way to allow proper French accountancy in ERPNext)

We can understand that add root_type to the check the uniqueness of a Account number may not please all country accountancy rules.
So we can also change the PR to always send root_type as parameters and not use it for standard/core test of uniqueness but add @erpnext.allow_regional on the validate_account_number() function.
Like that we can override it in [ERPNext France](https://github.com/scopen-coop/erpnext_france) app

> Explain the **details** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?

This PR make two changes :

    Use the same method/function on Account creation as on Account update to check the validity of the account number
    Send root_type as parameters to validate_account_number() to check account number uniqueness by company and root_type

- ToDos are only seen by System Managers (or by assignee or assigner), however this is not useful for incoming Invoices, nor is it useful to open up permissions as ToDos are inherently personal

2529979973,pull_request,closed,,fix: A project without tasks should be able to complete (backport #42969),"This fix solves a bug where, when completing a project without tasks, it will fail to close.

- If a project without tasks is set to ""Completed"", either through setting the project status directly or with the ""set_project_status"" function, the status is not changed but reverted back to ""Open"".

- The reason for this behaviour is, that since there are no tasks to provide a completion percentage erpnext will not accept the ""Completed"" status.

- While failing the bug does not throw an error or warning message to the user, hence I am assuming the behaviour is unintentional and needs to be fixed.

- This fix solves the bug by changing the completion type to manual on completing the project if there are no tasks within the project

2528637888,pull_request,closed,,fix: hide and reset discount control on new POS order (backport #43176),"Issue: In POS the additional discount label is not getting removed in the new order.

Steps to Replicate:
- Create an order with a discount.
-  Complete the order and make a new order.
- When we make a new order, the system shows that an additional discount is applied. It should not display the message that the discount is not getting applied. The new order discount % must be reset.
